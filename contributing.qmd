<!-- [ ] Tie together as a 'Research compendium' (report and reproducible research environment -->

We have discused how to design and conduct research that is purposive, inquisitive, informed, and methodical. The task now is to share the results of the research in a manner that is communicable. There are two primary ways to communicate the results of research: audience-oriented and research-oriented. That is that audience facing research communication includes presentations, articles, and other forms of dissemination that are intended for audiences to become familiar with the research in a general sense. Research-facing communication, on the other hand, is intended for other researchers and is often more detailed and technical, this includes research documents, data, and code that allow other researchers to reproduce and/ or build upon the research. In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of clear and effective communication in research reporting, and the strategies for ensuring that your research project is reproducible.

## Audience oriented {#sec-contr-audience-oriented}

- Popular and scholarly dissemination
  - Presentations
  - Articles
  - Blog posts
  - Social media

In this section, we first examine the role of research presentations in academic and professional settings, highlighting the benefits of presenting one's work as a means to develop and refine ideas and conclusions. We then discuss the purpose of a research document, focusing on how its structure effectively conveys the project's rationale, goals, procedures, results, and findings.

- Importance of clear and effective communication in research
  - Enhances understanding of the research
  - Facilitates collaboration and interdisciplinary work
- Presentations
  - Goals:
    - Sharing research findings
    - Developing and refining ideas and conclusions through feedback and discussion
  - Strategies
    - Storytelling and relatability
    - "Less is more" approach (i.e. avoiding information overload)
- Write-ups
  - Goals:
    - Communicate research methodology and findings
    - Contribute to the body of knowledge
  - Strategies
    - Outlining the main sections
    - Maintaining logical flow and consistency
    - Using clear and concise language

- Literate programming
  - Goals:
    - Enhance the reproducibility of research
    - Facilitate the sharing of research findings
  - In audience oriented communication, literate programming can facilitate accurate and timely dissemination of research findings.
  - Strategies
    - Quarto for creating research presentations and documents
    - Incorporating data visualization, tables, and other R-generated content seamlessly
      - `ggplot2::ggsave()` for saving figures
      - `kableExtra::save_kable()` for saving tables
    - Using R and Quarto to apply formatting guidelines

## Research oriented {#sec-contr-research-oriented}

- Academic exchange
  - Technical/implementation disclosure
  - Scientific collaboration
  - Reproducible research

Whether for other researchers or for your future self, creating research that is well-documented and reproducible is a fundamental part of conducting modern scientific inquiry. In this section, we will emphasize the importance of this endeavor and outline strategies for ensuring your research project is reproducible. This will include directory and file structure, key documentation files as well as how to effectively use existing software resources and frameworks for publishing your research.

- Importance of well-documented and reproducible research in modern scientific inquiry
  - Ensuring accuracy and reliability of results
  - Facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration
    - Combining expertise from different fields.
    - Peer review and feedback.
- Elements
  - Research compendium
    - Directory and file structure/ naming conventions
    - Key documentation files, README, data origin, dictionaries, Quarto
    - Instructions for running the analysis
  - Computing environment
    - Directory and file management
      - Open source formats, software, and tools
      - Version control
        - Ethical considerations (data privacy, security, etc.)
    - Software management
      - R and package management (`renv`)
    - System-level dependencies
      - Docker (or `rix`) for containerization
  - Publishing research
    - Popular repositories (e.g., GitHub, Open Science Framework)
    - Strategies for uploading and organizing research projects
    - Collaboration best practices
