When reporting the results of a supervised machine learning model it is important to report the evaluation metrics that are most relevant to the problem at hand. For example, if the problem is to predict a numeric outcome, then the most relevant evaluation metric is the mean squared error (MSE). It is often useful to report the root mean squared error (RMSE) as well. 

However, if the problem is to predict the class, then the most relevant evaluation metric is the accuracy. Other evaluation metrics that are often reported are the precision, recall, and F1-score. It can also be useful to report the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

If the research goal is focused on prediction accuracy, then these statistics are the most relevant. But in other cases, the supervised learning alogrithm is a means to guage a relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables, namely to guage the most important predictor variables. The model can then be used to identify those predictor variables that support accurate predictions and even to identify those predictor variables that do not support accurate predictions. Note, however, that some supervised learning algorithms are not able to identify the most important predictor variables. For example, neural networks are not able to identify the most important predictor variables. These 'black box' algorithms may lead to accurate predictions, but they do not provide any insight into the underlying relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables.

In this chapter, we first examine the role of research presentations in academic and professional settings, highlighting the benefits of presenting one's work as a means to develop and refine ideas and conclusions. We then discuss the purpose of a research document, focusing on how its structure effectively conveys the project's rationale, goals, procedures, results, and findings. Additionally, we explore the integration of citations, references, figures, and tables in research documents using Quarto. Lastly, we investigate the application of field-specific and publishing house formats to a variety of document formats, such as Word, PDF, HTML, and ePub.

Whether for other researchers or for your future self, creating research that is well-documented and reproducible is a fundamental part of conducting modern scientific inquiry. In this chapter we will emphasize the importance of this endeavor and outline strategies for ensuring your research project is reproducible. This will include directory and file structure, key documentation files as well as how to effectively use existing software resources and frameworks for publishing your research (either for private use, journal requirements, or general public consumption) on popular repositories such as GitHub and Open Science Framework (OSF).

Reproducibility is the ability to recreate the results of a research project. This is a fundamental part of the scientific process and is a key component of the scientific method. Reproducibility is important for several reasons. First, it allows other researchers to verify the results of a study. Second, it allows other researchers to build on the results of a study. Third, it allows researchers to revisit their own work at a later date. Fourth, it allows researchers to share their work with others. Finally, it allows researchers to use their work as a template for future projects.
