When reporting the results of a supervised machine learning model it is important to report the evaluation metrics that are most relevant to the problem at hand. For example, if the problem is to predict a numeric outcome, then the most relevant evaluation metric is the mean squared error (MSE). It is often useful to report the root mean squared error (RMSE) as well. 

However, if the problem is to predict the class, then the most relevant evaluation metric is the accuracy. Other evaluation metrics that are often reported are the precision, recall, and F1-score. It can also be useful to report the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

If the research goal is focused on prediction accuracy, then these statistics are the most relevant. But in other cases, the supervised learning alogrithm is a means to guage a relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables, namely to guage the most important predictor variables. The model can then be used to identify those predictor variables that support accurate predictions and even to identify those predictor variables that do not support accurate predictions. Note, however, that some supervised learning algorithms are not able to identify the most important predictor variables. For example, neural networks are not able to identify the most important predictor variables. These 'black box' algorithms may lead to accurate predictions, but they do not provide any insight into the underlying relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables.
