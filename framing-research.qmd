At this point in this part of the textbook, we have covered Data, Information, and Knowledge from the Data to Insight Hierarchy. The goal has been to provide an orientation to the main building blocks of doing text analysis. Insight is the last component of the hierarchy. However, in practical terms, it is the first step to address in an research project as goals of a research project influence all subsequent steps.

In this chapter we discuss how to frame research, that is how to position your research project's findings to contribute insight to understanding of the world. We will cover how to connect with the literature, selecting a research area and identifying a research problem, and how to design research best positioned to return relevant findings that will connect with this literature, establishing a research aim and research question. We will round out this chapter with a guide on developing a research blueprint --a working plan to organize the conceptual and practical steps to implement the research effectively and in a way that supports communicating the research findings and the process by which the findings were obtained.

## Frame {#sec-fr-frame}

Together a research area, problem, aim and question and the research blueprint that forms the conceptual and practical scaffolding of the project ensure from the outset that the project is solidly grounded in the main characteristics of good research. These characteristics, summarized by @Cross2006, are found in @tbl-fr-cross-research-char-table.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fr-cross-research-char-table
#| tbl-cap: 'Characteristics of research (Cross, 2006).'

research_chars <-
  tribble(
    ~"Characteristic", ~"Description",
    "Purposive", "Based on identification of an issue or problem worthy and capable of investigation",
    "Inquisitive", "Seeking to acquire new knowledge",
    "Informed", "Conducted from an awareness of previous, related research",
    "Methodical", "Planned and carried out in a disciplined manner",
    "Communicable", "Generating and reporting results which are feasible and accessible by others"
  )
research_chars |>
  kable()
```

With these characteristics in mind, let's get started with the first component to address --connecting with the literature.

<!-- Before jumping into the code, every researcher must come to a project with a clear idea about the purpose of the analysis. This means doing your homework in order to understand what it is exactly that you want to achieve; that is, you need to identify a research question. The first step is become versed in the previous literature on the topic. What has been written? What are the main findings? Secondly, it is important to become familiar with the standard methods for approaching the topic of interest. How has the topic been approached methodologically? What are the types, sources, and quality of data employed? What have been the statistical approaches employed? What particular statistical tests have been chosen? Getting an overview not only of the domain-specific findings in the literature but also the methodological choices will help you identify promising plan for carrying out your research. -->


<!-- discuss how to develop a research plan, or what I will call a ‘research blueprint.’ At this point we will directly address Research Skills and elaborate on how research really comes together; how to bring yourself up to speed with the literature on a topic, how to develop a research goal or hypothesis, how to select data which is viable to address the research goal or hypothesis, how to determine the necessary information and appropriate measures to prepare for analysis, how to perform diagnostic statistics on the data and make adjustments before analysis, how to select and perform the relevant analytic statistics given the research goals, how to report your findings, and finally, how to structure your project so that it is well-documented and reproducible. -->


## Connect {#sec-fr-connect}

### Research area

The first decision to make in the research process is to identify a research area. A **research area** is a general area of interest where a researcher wants to derive insight and make a contribution to understanding. For those with an established research trajectory in language, the area of research to address through text analysis will likely be an extension of their prior work. For others, which include new researchers or researcher's that want to explore new areas of language research or approach an area through a language-based lens, the choice of area may be less obvious. In either case, the choice of a research area should be guided by a desire to contribute something relevant to a theoretical, social, and/ or practical matter of personal interest. Personal relevance goes a long way to developing and carrying out __purposive__ and __inquisitive__ research. 

So how do we get started? The first step is to reflect on your own areas of interest and knowledge, be it academic, professional, or personal. Language is at the heart of the human experience and therefore found in some fashion anywhere one seeks to find it. But it is a big world and more often than not the general question about what area to explore language use is sometimes the most difficult. To get the ball rolling, it is helpful to peruse disciplinary encyclopedias or handbooks of linguistics and language-related an academic fields (e.g. [Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080448541/encyclopedia-of-language-and-linguistics) [@Brown2005], [A Practical Guide to Electronic Resources in the Humanities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781843345978/a-practical-guide-to-electronic-resources-in-the-humanities) [@Dubnjakovic2010], [Routledge encyclopedia of translation technology](https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315749129) [@Chan2014])

A more personal, less academic, approach is to consult online forums, blogs, *etc*. that one already frequents or can be accessed via an online search. For example, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) has a wide variety of active subreddits ([r/LanguageTechnology](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/), [r/Linguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/), [r/corpuslinguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/corpuslinguistics/), [r/DigitalHumanities](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalHumanities/), *etc*.). Twitter and Facebook also have interesting posts on linguistics and language-related fields worth following. Through one of these social media site you may find particular people that maintain a blog worth browsing. For example, I follow [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/), [Rachel Tatman](http://www.rctatman.com/), and [Ted Underwood](https://tedunderwood.com/), *inter alia*. Perusing these resources can help spark ideas and highlight the kinds of questions that interest you. 

Regardless of whether your inquiry stems from academic, professional, or personal interest, try to connect these findings to academic areas of research. Academic research is highly structured and well-documented and making associations with this network will aid in subsequent steps in developing a research project.

### Research problem {#sec-fr-problem}

Once you've made a rough-cut decision about the area of research, it is now time to take a deeper dive into the subject area and jump into the literature. This is where the rich structure of disciplinary research will provide aid to traverse the vast world of academic knowledge and identify a research problem. A **research problem** highlights a particular topic of debate or uncertainty in existing knowledge which is worthy of study. 

Surveying the relevant literature is key to ensuring that your research is __informed__, that is, connected to previous work. Identifying relevant research to consult can be a bit of a 'chicken or the egg' problem --some knowledge of the area is necessary to find relevant topics, some knowledge of the topics is necessary to narrow the area of research. Many times the only way forward is to jump into conducting searches. These can be world-accessible resources (*e.g.* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)) or limited-access resources that are provided through an academic institution (*e.g.* [Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts](https://about.proquest.com/en/products-services/llba-set-c)), [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/), [PsycINFO](https://www.ebsco.com/products/research-databases/apa-psycinfo), *etc.*). Some organizations and academic institutions provide [research guides](https://guides.zsr.wfu.edu/linguistics) to help researcher's access the primary literature. 

Another avenue to explore are journals dedicated to areas in which linguistics and language-related research is published. In @tbl-pinboard-journals-linguistics, @tbl-pinboard-journals-humanities, and @tbl-pinboard-journals-cl, I've listed a number of highly visible journals in linguistics, digital humanities, and computational linguistics.

```{r}

To explore research related to text analysis it is helpful to start with the (sub)discipline name(s) you identified in when selecting your research area, more specific terms that occur to you or key terms from the literature, and terms such as 'corpus study' or 'corpus-based'. The results from first searches may not turn out to be sources that end up figuring explicitly in your research, but it is important to skim these results and the publications themselves to mine information that can be useful to formulate better and more targeted searches. Relevant information for honing your searches can be found throughout an academic publication (article or book). However, pay particular attention to the abstract, in articles, and the table of contents, in books, and the cited references. Abstracts and tables of contents often include discipline-specific jargon that is commonly used in the field. In some articles there is even a short list of key terms listed below the abstract which can be extremely useful to seed better and more precise search results. The references section will contain relevant and influential research. Scan these references for publications which appear to narrowing in on topic of interest and treat it like a search in its own right.


Once your searches begin to show promising results it is time to keep track and organize these references. Whether you plan to collect thousands of references over a lifetime of academic research or your aim is centered around one project, software such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)^[[Zotero Guide](https://guides.zsr.wfu.edu/zotero)], [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager), or [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/) provide powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use tools to collect, organize, annotate, search, and export references. Citation management software is indispensable for modern research --and often free! 

As your list of relevant references grows, you will want to start the investigation process in earnest. Begin skimming (not reading) the contents of each of these publications, starting with the most relevant first^[Or what appears to be most relevant. This may change as you start to take a closer look.]. Annotate these publications using highlighting features of the citation management software to identify: (1) the stated goal(s) of the research, (2) the data source(s) used, (3) the information drawn from the data source(s), (4) the analysis approach employed, and (5) the main finding(s) of the research as they pertain to the stated goal(s). Next, in your own words, summarize these five key areas in prose adding your summary to the notes feature of the citation management software. This process will allow you to efficiently gather and document references with the relevant information to guide the identification of a research problem, to guide the formation of your problem statement, and ultimately, to support the literature review that will figure in your project write-up.

From your preliminary annotated summaries you will undoubtedly start to recognize overlapping and contrasting aspects in the research literature. These aspects may be topical, theoretical, methodological, or appear along other lines. Note these aspects and continue to conduct more refine searches, annotate new references, and monitor for any  emerging patterns of uncertainty or debate (gaps) which align with your research interest(s). When a promising pattern takes shape, it is time to engage with a more detailed reading of those references which appear most relevant highlighting the potential gap(s) in the literature. 

At this point you can focus energy on more nuanced aspects of a particular gap in the literature with the goal to formulate a problem statement. A **problem statement** directly acknowledges a gap in the literature and puts a finer point on the nature and relevance of this gap for understanding. This statement reflects your first deliberate attempt to establish a line of inquiry. It will be a targeted, but still somewhat general, statement framing the gap in the literature that will guide subsequent research design decisions.

## Define {#sec-fr-define}

### Research aim {#sec-fr-aim}

With a problem statement in hand, it is now time to consider the goal(s) of the research. A **research aim** frames the type of inquiry to be conducted. Will the research aim to explore, examine, or explain? In other words, will the research seek to uncover novel relationships, assess the potential strength of a particular relationship, or test a particular relationship? As you can appreciate, the research aim is directly related to the analysis methods we touched upon in [Chapter 3](#sec-approaching-analysis).

To gauge how to frame your research aim, reflect on the literature that led you to your problem statement and the nature of the problem statement itself. If the gap at the center of the problem statement is a lack of knowledge, your research aim may be exploratory. If the gap concerns a conjecture about a relationship, then your research may take a predictive approach. When the gap points to the validation of a relationship, then your research will likely be inferential in nature. Before selecting your research aim it is also helpful to consult the research aims of the primary literature that led you to your research statement.

Typically, a problem statement addressing a subtle, specific issue tends to adopt research objectives similar to prior studies. In contrast, a statement focusing on a broader, more distinct issue is likely to have unique research goals. Yet, this is more of a guideline than a strict rule.

It's crucial to understand both the existing literature and the nature of various types of analyses. Being clear about your research goals is important to ensure that your study is well-placed to produce results that add value to the current understanding in an informed manner.

### Research question {#sec-fr-question}

The next step in research design is to craft the research question. A \index{research question}**research question** is clearly defined statement which identifies an aspect of uncertainty and the particular relationships that this uncertainty concerns. The research question extends and narrows the line of inquiry established in the research statement and research aim. To craft a research question, we can use the research statment for the content and the research aim for the form.

#### Form {#sec-fr-question-form}

The form of a research question will vary based on the research aim, which as I mentioned, is inimately connected to the analysis approach. For inferential-based research, the research question will actually be a statement, not a question. This statement makes a testable claim about the nature of a particular relationship --*i.e.* asserts a hypothesis. 

For illustration, let's return to the hypothesis ($H_1$) we previously sketched out in [Chapter 3](#sec-approaching-analysis), leaving aside the implicit null hypothesis, seen in @exm-fr-form-infer.

::: {#exm-fr-form-infer}
Women use more questions than men in spontaneous conversations.
:::

For predictive- and exploratory-based research, the research question is in fact a question. A reframing of the example hypothesis for a predictive-based research question might take the form seen in @exm-fr-form-pred.

::: {#exm-fr-form-pred}
Can the number of questions used in spontaneous conversations predict if a speaker is male or female?
:::

And a similar exploratory-based research question might take the form seen in @exm-fr-form-exp.

::: {#exm-fr-form-exp}
Do men and women differ in terms of the number of questions they use in spontaneous conversations?
:::

The central research interest behind these hypothetical research questions is, admittedly, quite basic. But from these simplified examples, we are able to appreciate the similarities and differences between the forms of research statements that correspond to distinct research aims.


#### Content {#sec-fr-question-content}

<!-- [ ] Revise unit of analysis and unit of observation, consult commented suggestions below. 

Note: I've now touched upon these concepts in the previous two chapters. Take this into account as I review the key aspects of forumulating a research question.

-->

In terms of content, the research question will make reference to two key components. First, is the unit of analysis. The **unit of analysis** is the entity which the research aims to investigate. For our three example research aims, the unit of analysis is the same, namely *speakers*. Note, however, that the current unit of analysis is somewhat vague in the example research questions. A more precise unit of analysis would include more information about the population from which the speakers are drawn (*i.e.* English speakers, American English speakers, American English speakers of the Southeast, *etc*.).

The second key component is the unit of observation. The **unit of observation** is the primary element on which the insight into the unit of analysis is derived and in this way constitutes the essential organizational unit of the dataset to be analyzed. In our examples, the unit of observation, again, is unchanged and is *spontaneous conversations*. Note that while the unit of observation is key to identify as it forms the organizational backbone of the research, it is very common for the research to derive variables from this unit to provide evidence to investigate the research question. 

In examples [-@exm-fr-form-infer], [-@exm-fr-form-pred], and [-@exm-fr-form-exp], we identified the number of conversations as part of the research question. Later in the research process it will be key to operationalize this variable. For example, will the number of conversations be the total number of conversations in the dataset or will it be the average number of conversations per speaker? These are important questions to consider as they will influence variable selection, statistical choices, and ultimately  the interpretation of the results.

<!-- But in other cases a researcher may seek to understand other aspects of questions in spontaneous conversations (*e.g.* type of question, features of questions, *etc.*). The unit of observation, however, would remain the same. -->

<!--  
The *unit of analysis refers to the entity that is studied and analyzed* in a research study or corpus linguistics, while the *unit of observation refers to the specific item or element that is actually observed or measured* within the selected unit of analysis. In simpler terms, the unit of analysis is the larger context while the unit of observation is the subset within that context.

Examples of primary unit of analysis:

* Words: The most common unit of analysis in corpus linguistics is the word. Researchers often examine the use of different types of words, such as nouns or verbs, or the frequency of specific individual words.

* Phrases: Phrases can also be a useful unit of analysis in corpus linguistics. For example, researchers might examine the frequency of certain collocations or the use of particular grammatical structures.

* Sentences: Sentences can provide valuable insights into how language is used, particularly in terms of syntax and grammar. Researchers might analyze sentence length or the use of specific sentence structures.

* Discourse: Discourse refers to larger units of language use, such as conversations, speeches, or written texts. Researchers might analyze patterns in discourse, such as how speakers use language to convey social status or power.

* Speakers/Writers: Another important unit of analysis in corpus linguistics is the individual speaker or writer. Researchers might analyze differences between male and female speakers, regional dialects, or the language use of different age groups.

* Language and language varieties: Researchers might also analyze differences between languages or language varieties. For example, researchers might compare the use of different types of words in English and Spanish, or the use of different grammatical structures in British and American English.

Examples of primary unit of observation:

* Tokens
* Types
* Lemmas
* Part-of-speech tags
* Sentences
* Paragraphs
* Documents
* Speakers
* Languages
* Genres
* Years/time periods
* Social media posts
* Comments/reviews
* Text messages


Note that the unit of observation is the entity or object on which data is collected or measured and there can be multiple units of observation for a given unit of analysis. 


-->


## Blueprint {#sec-fr-blueprint}

Efforts to craft a research question are a very important aspect of developing purposive, inquisitive, and informed research (returning to Cross's characteristics of research). Moving beyond the research question in the project means developing and laying out the research design in a way such that the research is __Methodical__ and __Communicable__. In this textbook, the method to achieve these goals is through the development of a research blueprint. The blueprint includes two components: (1) laying out a conceptual plan and (2) deriving the organizational scaffolding that will support the implementation of the research.

As @Ignatow2017 point out:

> Research design is essentially concerned with the basic architecture of research projects, with designing projects as systems that allow theory, data, and research methods to interface in such a way as to maximize a project’s ability to achieve its goals [...]. Research design involves a sequence of decisions that have to be taken in a project's early stages, when one oversight or poor decision can lead to results that are ultimately trivial or untrustworthy. Thus, it is critically important to think carefully and systematically about research design before committing time and resources to acquiring texts or mastering software packages or programming languages for your text mining project.

In what follows, I will cover the main aspects of developing a research blueprint. I will start with the conceptual plan and then move on to the organizational scaffolding.

### Plan {#sec-fr-plan}

Importance of establishing a feasible research design from the outset and documenting the key aspects required to conduct the research cannot be understated. On the one hand this process links a conceptual plan to a tangible implementation. In doing so, a researcher is better-positioned to conduct research with a clear view of what will be entailed. On the other hand, a promising research question may present unexpected challenges once a researcher sets about to implement the research. This is not uncommon to encounter issues that require modification or reevaluation of the viability of the project. However, a well-documented research plan will help a researcher to identify and address many of these challenges at the conceptual level before expending effort on the implementation.

Let's now consider the main aspects of developing a research plan: identifying data source(s), key variables, and analysis methods. Before we do, however, it is important to reiterate the importance of a research question or hypothesis before moving forward in research planning. The research question or hypothesis is the central component of the research plan. It guides every step which follows from data selection to interpretation of the analysis results. Furthermore, a well-founded research question is based on a solid literature review from which can provide helpful guidance at key choice points in the research process.

<!-- Identify: Data -->

First, __identify a viable data source__. Viability includes the accessibility of the data, availability of the data, and the content of the data. If a purported data source is not accessible and/ or is has stringent restrictions on its use, then it is not a viable data source. If a data source is accessible and available, but does not contain the building blocks needed to address the research question, then it is not a viable data source. In the case that research is inferential in nature, the sampling frame of the corpus is of primary importance as the goal is to generalize the findings to a target population. A corpus resource should align, to the extent feasible, with this target population. For predictive and exploratory research, the goal to generalize a claim is not central and for this reason the there is some freedom in terms of how representative a corpus sample is of a target population. Ideally, a researcher will find and be able to model a language population of target interest. Since the goal, however, is not to test a hypothesis, but rather to explore particular or evaluate potential relationships, either in an exploratory or predictive fashion, the research can often continue with the stipulation that the results are interpreted in the light of the characteristics of the available corpus sample.

<!-- 
- [ ] Consider: examples of research questions and corpus resources that do and do not align 
-->

<!-- Identify: Information -->

The second step is to __identify the key variables__ need to conduct the research are and then ensure that this information can be derived from the corpus data. The research question will reference the unit of analysis and the unit of observation, but it is important at this point to then pinpoint what the key variables will be. If the unit of observation is spontaneous conversations. The question as to what aspects of these conversations will be used in the analysis. In the research questions presented in this chapter, we will want to envision what needs to be done to derive a variable which measures the number of questions in each of the conversations. In other research, their may be features that need to be extracted, recoded, and/ or generated to address the research question. Other variables of importance may be non-linguistic in nature. In cases where there the metadata is incomplete for the goals of the research, it is sometimes possible to merge metadata from other sources. 

<!-- Interrogate: Analysis methods -->

<!-- 
- [ ] Reorder these to match the Approaching Analysis section 
-->

The third step is to __identify a method of analysis__ to interrogate the dataset. The selection of the analysis approach that was part of the research aim (*i.e.* explore, predict, or infer) and then the research question goes a long way to narrowing the methods that a researcher must consider. But there are a number of factors which will make some methods more appropriate than others. 

Exploratory research is the least restricted of the three types of analysis approaches. Although it may be the case that a research will not be able to specify from the outset of a project what the exact analysis methods will be, an attempt to consider what types of analysis methods will be most promising to provide results to address the research question goes a long way to steering a project in the right direction and grounding the research. As with the other analysis approaches, it is important to be aware of what the analysis methods available and what type of information they produce in light of the research question. 

For predictive-based research, the informational value of the target variable is key to deciding whether the prediction will be a classification task or a regression task. This has downstream effects when it comes time to evaluate and interpret the results. Although the feature engineering process in predictive analyses means that the features do not need to be specified from the outset and can be tweaked and changed as needed during an analysis, it is a good idea to start with a basic sense of what features most likely will be helpful in developing a robust predictive model. Furthermore, while the number and informational values of the features (predictor variables) are not as important to selecting a prediction method (algorithm) as they are in inferential analysis methods, it is important to recognize that particular algorithms have strengths and shortcomings when working large numbers and/ or types of features [@Lantz2013]. 

In inferential research, the number and information values of the variables to be analyzed will be of key importance [@Gries2013a]. The informational value of the dependent variable will again narrow the search for the appropriate method. The number of predictor variables also plays an important role. For example, a study with a categorical dependent variable with a single categorical predictor variable will lead the researcher to the Chi-squared test. A study with a numeric dependent variable with multiple predictor variables will lead to linear regression. Another aspect of note for inference studies is the consideration of the distribution of numeric variables --a normal distribution will use a parametric test where a non-normal distribution will use a non-parametric test. These details need not be nailed down at this point, but it is helpful to have them on your radar to ensure that when the time comes to analyze the data, the appropriate steps are taken to test for normality and then apply the correct test. 

<!-- [ ] Add method of evaluation/ criteria for evaluation -->

The last of the main components of the research plan concerns the **interpretation and evaluation of the results**. This step brings the research plan full circle connecting the research question to the methods employed. It is important to establish from the outset what the criteria will be to evaluate the results. This is in large part a function of the relationship between the research question and the analysis method. For example, in exploratory research, the results will be evaluated qualitatively in terms of the associative patterns that emerge. Predictive and inferential research leans more heavily on quantitative metrics in particular the accuracy of the prediction or the strength of the relationship between the dependent and predictor variable(s), respectively. However, these quantitative metrics require qualitative interpretation to determine whether the results are meaningful in light of the research question.

<!-- [ ] Edit to prepare for plan checklist table -->

To summarize these planning steps, I've created a checklist in @tbl-fr-plan-checklist.

| Steps   | Description  |
|---|---|
| **Research Question or Hypothesis**  | Formulate a research question or hypothesis based on a thorough review of existing literature including references. This will guide every subsequent step from data selection to interpretation of results.  |
| **Data Source(s)**  | Identify viable data source(s) and vet the sample data in light of the research question. Consider to what extent the goal is to generalize findings to a target population, and ensure that the corpus aligns as much as feasible with this target.  |
| **Key Variables**  | Determine the key variables needed for the research, define how they will be operationalized, and ensure they can be derived from the corpus data. Additionally, identify any features that need to be extracted, recoded or generated.  |
| **Analysis Method**  | Choose an appropriate method of analysis to interrogate the dataset. This choice should be in line with your research aim (*e.g.*, exploratory, predictive, inferential). Be aware of what each method can offer and how it addresses your research question.  |
| **Interpretation & Evaluation**  | Establish criteria to interpret and evaluate the results. This will be a function of the relationship between the research question and the analysis method.  |

: Research Plan Checklist {#tbl-fr-plan-checklist tbl-colwidths="[25, 75]"}

<!-- Document stengths and shortcomings and identify contingency plans -->

In addition to addressing the steps outlined in @tbl-fr-plan-checklist, it is also important to document the strengths and shortcomings of the research plan including the data source(s), the information to be extracted from the data, and the analysis methods. If there are potential shortcomings, which there most often are, sketch out contingency plans to address these shortcomings. This will help buttress your research and ensure that your time and effort is well-spent.

Together the information collected from this process will serve to guide the research and provide a solid foundation for the research write-up. Furthermore, you may consider pre-registering your research project to ensure that your plans are well-documented and to provide a timestamp for your research. Pre-registration can also be a helpful way to get feedback on your research plan from colleagues and experts in the field. Popular pre-registration platforms include [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) and [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg).

### Scaffold {#sec-fr-scaffold}

The next step in creating a research blueprint is to consider how to physically implement your project. This includes how to organize files and directories in a fashion that both provides the researcher a logical and predictable structure to work with but also ensures that the research is __Communicable__. On the one hand, communicable research includes a strong write-up of the research, but, on the other hand, it is also important that the research is reproducible. Reproducibility strategies are a benefit to the researcher (in the moment and in the future) as it leads to better work habits and to better teamwork and it makes changes to the project easier. Reproducibility is also of benefit to the scientific community as shared reproducible research enhances replicability and encourages cumulative knowledge development [@Gandrud2015]. 

There are a set of guiding principles to accomplish these goals [@Gentleman2007; @Marwick2018], seen in @exm-fr-repro-principles. 

::: {#exm-fr-repro-principles}
**Reproducible Research Principles**

1. All files should be plain text which means they contain no formatting information other than whitespace.
2. There should be a clear separation between the data, method, and output of research. This should be apparent from the directory structure. 
3. A separation between original, derived, and analysis data should be made. Original data should be treated as 'read-only'. Any changes to the original data should be justified, generated by the code, and documented (see point 6).
4. Each project file (script) should represent a particular, well-defined step in the research process. 
5. Each project script should be modular --that is, each file should correspond to a specific goal in the analysis procedure with input and output only corresponding to this step. 
6. All project scripts should be tied together by a 'main' script that is used to coordinate the execution of all the project steps. 
7. Everything should be documented. This includes data collection, data preprocessing, analysis steps, script code comments, data description in data dictionaries, information about the computing environment and packages used to conduct the analysis, and detailed instructions on how to reproduce the research. <!-- [ ] edit this to include the language of previous chapters: data origin, data dictionary, codebook, scripts, code comments, session info, README, etc. -->
:::

These seven principles can be physically implemented in numerous ways. In recent years, there has been a growing number of efforts to create R packages and templates to quickly generate the scaffolding and tools to facilitate reproducible research. Some notable R packages include [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) [@R-workflowr], [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) [@R-ProjectTemplate], and [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) [@R-targets], but there are many other resources for R included on the [CRAN Task View for Reproducible Research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html). There are many advantages to working with pre-existing frameworks for the savvy R programmer including the ability to quickly generate a project scaffold, to efficiently manage changes to the project, and to buy in to a common framework that is supported by a community of developers.

<!-- [ ] Revise to include only the basic principles. Stay agnostic to the implementation in the textbook. I may add info on the qtalrkit package website/ or GitHub repo. -->

On the other hand, these frameworks can be a bit daunting for the novice R programmer. At the most basic level, a project can implement the seven principles outlined above by creating a directory structure and a set of files manually.

In @exm-fr-basic-project, I provide a minimal framework that aligns with the reproducible research principles. Let me now make the connections between the principles and this project structure.

::: {.callout}

The *project/* directory is composed of three main sections: *data/*, *output/*, and *code/* corresponding to the input, output, and code, respectively.

The *data/* section is divided into three subsections: 

- *analysis/* for storing data used to perform analysis
- *derived/* for housing data produced in curation and transformation steps
- *original/* for keeping the original 'read-only' data

The *output/* section contains four subsections:

- *figures/* for visualizations produced as part of the project
- *reports/* for the resulting reports (*e.g.* article, presentation, blog post, *etc.*)
- *results/* for statistical results from the analysis
- *tables/* for summary tables

The *code/* directory houses the code, with the *_main.R* file at the root of the project orchestrating the execution of all project steps.

Lastly, the *README* file provides a description of the project and instructions on how to reproduce the research.
:::

The project structure in @exm-fr-basic-project meets the minimal structural requirements for reproducible research but can be augmented in more sophisticated ways to support more functionality, as we will see in @sec-collaboration. One enhancement that I highly recommend is the use of literate programming, in the form of Quarto documents, to serve as the main project scripts. This facilitates the combination of executable code and prose documentation for each project step in a single, modular file.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

The aim of this chapter is to provide the key conceptual and practical points to guide the development of a viable research project. Good research is purposive, inquisitive, informed, methodological, and communicable. It is not, however, always a linear process. Exploring your area(s) of interest and connecting with existing work will help couch and refine your research. But practical considerations, such as the existence of viable data, technical skills, and/ or time constrains, sometimes pose challenges and require a researcher to rethink and/ or redirect the research in sometimes small and other times more significant ways. The process of formulating a research question and developing a viable research plan is key to supporting viable, successful, and insightful research. To ensure that the effort to derive insight from data is of most value to the researcher and the research community, the research should strive to be methodological and communicable adopting best practices for reproducible research.

This chapter concludes the Foundations part of this textbook. At this stage our overview of fundamental characteristics of research are in place to move a project towards implementation, as seen in @fig-fr-visual-summary. From this point forward we will integrate your conceptual knowledge and emerging R programming skills as we cover common scenarios encountered when conducting reproducible research with real-world data.

The next part, Preparation, aims to cover R coding strategies to acquire, curate, and transform data in preparation for analysis. These are the first steps in putting a research blueprint into action and by no coincidence the first components in the Data to Insight Hierarchy. Without further ado, let's get started!

Chapter 5 "Designing your research project"

> Research design is essentially concerned with the basic architecture of research projects, with designing projects as systems that allow theory, data, and research methods to interface in such a way as to maximize a project’s ability to achieve its goals (see Figure 5.1). Research design involves a sequence of decisions that have to be taken in a project’s early stages, when one oversight or poor decision can lead to results that are ultimately trivial or untrustworthy. Thus, it is critically important to think carefully and systematically about research design before committing time and resources to acquiring texts or mastering software packages or programming languages for your text mining project.

Chapter 3 "Research Designs: Linguistically Meaningful Research Questions, Observational Units, Variables, and Dispersion"

- Research questions should drive decisions about the choice of observational unit, how variables are defined, and the choice of research design.
- Observational units can be defined at the level of the linguistic feature,
the text, or the corpus.
- Variables can be measured qualitatively, according to variants of a
linguistic feature, or quantitatively, using rates of occurrence for features.

Chapter 7 "Interpreting Quantitative Results"

- Linguistics is done by linguists, not by computers.
- In order to be useful, quantitative corpus linguistic analysis should be
coupled with sound qualitative interpretation.
- Researchers can rely on linguistic context, text-external context, and
linguistic theory to guide their interpretation of quantitative corpus findings.
