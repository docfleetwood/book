    "text": "11.1 Audience oriented\nDissemination of research findings is a critical part of the research process. Whether it is through presentations, articles, blog posts, or social media, the ability to effectively communicate the results of research is essential for the impact and dissemination of research. Furthermore, the act of composing a research document can help to develop and refine ideas and conclusions.\nThe two most common forms of research dissemination in academics are presentations and articles. Both share a common goal: to effectively communicate the research to an audience. However, they also have distinct purposes and require different approaches to achieve their goals. These purposes complement each other, with presentations often serving as a means to engage and elicit feedback from an audience, and articles serving as a more comprehensive and permanent record of the research.",

    "text": "11.1.1 Structure\nFirst, let’s focus on the common structural components.\n\n\nTable 11.1: Common components of research presentations and articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nPurpose\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide context and rationale based on previous research\n\n\nMethods\nDescribe the research design and procedures\n\n\nResults\nPresent the findings including key statistics and table and/ or visual summaries\n\n\nDiscussion\nInterpret the findings and discuss implications\n\n\nConclusion\nSummarize the research and suggest future work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe components in Table 11.1 reflect the typical structure for presenting research in the social sciences (S. T. Gries 2016; S. Th. Gries and Paquot 2020; Sternberg and Sternberg 2010). Their combined purpose is to trace the research narrative from the rationale and goals to connecting the findings with the research questions and aims.\nWhen research is connected to a well-designed plan, as described in Chapter 4, many of these components are already in place. The steps taken to identify an area and a problem or gap in the literature find themselves in the introduction. This section builds the case for the research and provides the context for the research question(s) and aim(s). The methods section describes the research design and procedures, including the data collection and analysis steps that are key to contextualize the findings. In the results section, the findings are presented in the appropriate manner given the research aim and the analysis performed.\nThe discussion and conclusions sections, however, are where the research narrative is brought together. Crafting these sections can be seen as an extension of the research process itself. Instead of elaborating on the planning steps and their implementation, the discussion focus on the interpretation of the findings in the light of the research questions and previous literature. At this stage, the act of articulating the implications of the findings is where insights are developed and refined. The conclusion, for its part, puts a finer point on the research, but also is an opportunity to extend suggestions to where subsequent research might go.\nThe research abstract is another important component of both presentations and articles. I have not included it in Table 11.1 as it is a distillation of the entire research narrative. Furthermore, the purpose of the abstract is distinct between presentations and articles. In presentations, the abstract typically serves to provide conference referees and attendees with a summary of the research. In articles, the abstract helps readers decide whether the article is relevant to their interests and worth the time to read in full.\n\n11.1.2 Purpose\nUnderstanding the roles of these common components play in contributing to the overall narrative is essential for effective research communication.\n\nYet, presentations and articles are not the same. They have distinct elements and goals that are unique to each form of communication. So too, each form of communication has its own goals and the approach to achieve these goals colors the way the research is communicated. ….\n… For example, presentations emphasize storytelling and relatability, the “less is more” approach, visual aids and interactive elements, and engaging the audience through questions or interactive elements. Articles, on the other hand, emphasize nuance and detail, the role of tables and figures in communicating complex findings, and the importance of the abstract in helping readers decide whether the article is relevant to their interests and worth the time to read in full.\nof the research there are also distinct elements that are unique to each form of communication.\ndiscuss the distinctive elements of research presentations, including storytelling and relatability, the “less is more” approach, visual aids and interactive elements, and engaging the audience through questions or interactive elements.\n\n11.1.3 Strategies\n\nIntroduction\n\nCollect and curate your references and resources with a reference manager (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, etc.)\n\nManage your ideas and keep notes\nOrganize your references and resources\nIntegrate your references and resources with your writing in Quarto through BibTeX entry citation keys\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nDocument your data and processing steps while conducting your research\n\nUse a data dictionary to describe your data\nUse literate programming to describe your data processing and analysis steps\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nSave key statistical results, tables, and visualizations as outputs\n\nStatistical results can be saved as R objects (e.g., saveRDS())\nTables and visualizations can be saved as files (e.g., ggsave(), kableExtra::save_kable())\n\n\n\n\nPublishing\n\nPresentations\n\nVarious presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, etc.) and slide sharing platforms (e.g., SlideShare, Speaker Deck, etc.)\nConsider using Quarto with revealjs for creating and sharing presentations\n\nFacilitates the integration of data, tables, and figures between presentations and articles\nEasily shareable and reproducible\n\n\n\n\nArticles\n\nQuarto provides ample support for creating and publishing articles\n\n\n.csl files for formatting references\nQuarto extensions for (some) journal-specific formatting\n\nPDF, HTML, and Word output formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dive deeper\nQuarto 1.4+ includes a ‘manuscript’ feature which provides a workflow for including source content, computations, and visualizations in a single document which links to these source documents.

    "text": "About\nBook\nThe goal of this textbook is to provide readers with foundational knowledge and practical skills in quantitative text analysis using the R programming language.\nBy the end of this textbook, readers will be able to identify, interpret and evaluate data analysis procedures and results to support research questions within language science. Additionally, readers will gain experience in designing and implementing research projects that involve processing and analyzing textual data employing modern programming strategies. This textbook aims to instill a strong sense of reproducible research practices, which are critical for promoting transparency, verification, and sharing of research findings.\nThis textbook is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox. It assumes no prior knowledge of programming or quantitative methods and prioritizes practical application and intuitive understanding over technical details.\nAuthor\nDr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of language corpora from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.",
