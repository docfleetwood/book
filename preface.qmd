:::

The purpose of this chapter is to present the rationale behind this textbook, outline the key learning objectives, describe the pedagogical approach, and identify the intended audience. Additionally, this chapter will provide readers with a guide to the book's structure and the scope of its content, as well as instructions for the instructor and a summary of supporting resources available. Finally, this chapter will provide readers with information on setting up their computing environment and where to seek support.

## Rationale 

Data science, an interdisciplinary field that combines knownledge and skills from statistics, computer science, and domain-specific expertise to extract meaningful insight from structured and unstructured data, has emerged as an exciting and rapidly growing field in recent years, driven in large part by the increase in computing power available to the average individual and the abundance of electronic data now available through the internet. These advances have become an integral part of the modern scientific landscape, with data-driven insights now being used to inform decision-making in a wide variety of academic fields, including linguistics and language-related disciplines.

This textbook seeks to meet this growing demand by providing an introduction to the fundamental concepts and practical programming skills from data science applied to the task of quantitative text analysis. It is intended primarily for undergraduate students, but may also be useful for graduates and researchers seeking to expand their methodological toolbox. The textbook takes a pedagogical approach which assumes no prior experience with statistics or programming, making it an accessible resource for novices beginning their exploration of quantitative text analysis methods.

## Aims 

The overarching goal of this textbook is to provide readers with foundational knowledge and practical skills to conduct and evaluate quantitative text analysis using the R programming language and other open source tools and technologies. The specific aims are to develop the reader's proficiency in three main areas:

-  **Data literacy:** Identify, interpret and evaluate data analysis procedures and results

> Throughout this textbook we will explore topics which will help you understand how data analysis methods derive insight from data. In this process you will be encouraged to critically evaluate connections across linguistic and language-related disciplines using data analysis knowledge and skills. Data literacy is an invaluable skillset for academics and professionals but also is an indispensable aptitude for in the 21st century citizens to navigate and actively participate in the 'Information Age' in which we live [@Carmi2020].

-  **Research skills:** Design, implement, and communicate quantitative research

> This aim does not differ significantly, in spirit, from common learning outcomes in a research methods course. However, working with text will incur a series of key steps in the selection, collection, and preparation of the data that are unique to text analysis projects. In addition, I will stress the importance of research documentation and creating reproducible research as an integral part of modern scientific inquiry [@Buckheit1995].

-  **Programming skills:** Apply programmatic strategies to develop and collaborate on reproducible research projects

> Modern data analysis, and by extension, text analysis is conducted using programming. There are various key reasons for this: a programming approach (1) affords researchers unlimited research freedom --if you can envision it, you can program it, (2) underlies well-documented and reproducible research [@Gandrud2015], and (3) invites researchers to engage more intimately with the data and the methods for analysis. 

These aims are important for linguistics students because they provide a foundation for concepts and in the skills required to succeed in the rapidly evolving landscape of 21st-century research. These abilities enable researchers to evaluate and conduct high-quality empirical investigation across linguistic fields on a wide variety of topics. Moreover, these skills go beyond linguistics research; they are widely applicable across many disciplines where quantitative data analysis and programming are becoming increasingly important. Thus, this textbook provides students with a comprehensive introduction to quantitative text analysis that is relevant to linguistics research and that equips them with valuable skills for their future careers.

## Approach 

The approach taken in this textbook is designed to accomodate linguistics students and researchers with little to no prior experience with programming or quantitative methods. With this in mind the objective is connect conceptual understanding with practical application. Real-world data and research tasks relevant to linguistics are used thoughtout the book to provide context and to motivate the learning process[^preface-data-lang]. Furthermore, as an introduction to the field, the textbook focuses on the most common and fundamental methods and techniques for quantitative text analysis and prioritizes breadth over depth and intuitive understanding over technical explanations. On the programming side, the Tidyverse approach to programming in R will be adopted. This approach provides a consistent syntax across different packages and is known for its legibility, making it easier for readers to understand and write code. Together, these strategies form an approach that is intended to provide readers with an accessible resource to gain a foothold in the field and to equip them with the knowledge and skills to apply quantitative text analysis in their own research.

[^preface-data-lang]: Research data and questions are primarily based on English for wide accessibility as it is the *de facto* language of academics and research. However, the methods and techniques presented in this textbook are applicable to many other languages.

## Structure 

The aims and approach described above is reflected in the overall structure of the book and each chapter.

### Book level 

At the book level, there are five interdependent parts: 

Part I "Orientation" provides the necessary background knowledge to situate quantitative text analysis in the wider context of data analysis and linguistic research and to provide a clearer picture of what text analysis entails and its range of applications.

The subsequent parts are directly aligned with the data analysis process. The building blocks of this process are reflected in 'Data to Insight Hierarchy (DIKI)' visualized in @fig-diki-hierarchy[^preface-1].

[^preface-1]: Adapted from @Ackoff1989 and @Rowley2007.

```{r}
#| label: fig-diki-hierarchy
#| fig-cap: 'Data to Insight Hierarchy (DIKI)'
#| fig-alt: 'Data to Insight Hierarchy (DIKI) which is a pyramid with the following levels: Data, Information, Knowledge, and Insight. The Data level is at the bottom and the Insight level is at the top. The Data level is the largest and the Insight level is the smallest.'
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("figures/preface/p-diki.drawio.png")
```

The DIKI Hierarchy highlights the stages and intermediate steps required to derive insight from data. Part II "Foundations" provides a conceptual introduction to the DIKI Hierarchy and establishes foundational knowledge about data, information, knowledge, and insight which is fundamental to developing a viable research plan. 

Parts III "Preparation" and IV "Analysis" focus on the implementation process. Part III covers the steps involved in preparing data for analysis, including data acquisition, curation, and transformation. Part IV covers the steps involved in conducting analysis, including exploratory, predictive, and inferential data analysis.

The final part, Part V "Communication", covers the final stage of the data analysis process, which is to communicate the results of the analysis. This includes the structure and content of research reports as well as the process of publishing, sharing, and collaborating on research.

### Chapter level 

At the chapter level, both conceptual and programming skills are developed in stages[^preface-3]. The chapter-level structure is consistent across chapters and can be seen in @tbl-structure-approach. 

[^preface-3]: These stages attempt to capture the general progression of learning reflected in Bloom's Taxonomy (see  @Krathwohl2002 for a description and revision).

| Component | Purpose | Resource | Stage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Outcomes | Identify the learning objectives for the chapter | Textbook | Introduction |
| Overview | Provide a brief introduction to the chapter topic | Textbook | Introduction |
| Coding Lessons | Teach programming techniques with hands-on interactive exercises | GitHub | Skills 
| Content | Combine conceptual discussions and programming skills, incorporating thought-provoking questions, relevant studies, and advanced topic references | Textbook | Knowledge |
| Recipes | Offer step-by-step programming examples related to the chapter | Resources website | Comprehension |
| Labs | Allow readers to apply chapter-specific concepts and techniques | GitHub | Application |
| Summary | Review the key concepts and skills covered in the chapter | Textbook | Review |
| Questions | Assess and expand the reader's knowledge and abilities | Textbook | Assessment |

: The general structure of a chapter including: the component, its purpose, where to find the resource, and the target learning stage. {#tbl-structure-approach}{tbl-colwidths="[15, 55, 15, 15]"}

Each chapter will begin with a list of key learning outcomes followed by a brief introduction to the chapter's content. The goal is to orient the reader to the chapter. Next there will be a prompt to complete the interactive coding lesson(s) to introduce reader's to key programming concepts related to the chapter though hands-on experience and then the main content of the chapter will follow. The content will be a combination of conceptual discussions and programming skills, incorporating thought-provoking questions ('Consider this'), relevant studies ('Case study'), and advanced topic references ('Dive deeper'). Together these components form the skills and knowledge phase. The next phase is the application phase. This phase will include step-by-step programming demonstrations related to the chapter (Recipes) and lab exercises that allow readers to apply their knowledge and skills chapter-related tasks. Finally the chapters conclude with a summary of the key concepts and skills covered in the chapter and a set of questions to assess and expand the reader's knowledge and abilities.

## Resources {#sec-resouces .unnumbered}

There are three main resources available to support the aims and approach of this textbook. Firstly, the textbook itself provides prose discussion, figures/ tables, R code, case studies, and thought and practical exercises. Secondly, there is a companion R package called `qtalrkit` [@R-qtalrkit], which includes functions for accessing data and datasets, as well as various useful functions developed specifically for this textbook. In addition, there is a comprehensive website [Quantitative Text Analysis for Linguistics Resources](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/)(qtalr website) that includes programming tutorials and demonstrations to enhance the reader's recognition of how programming strategies are implemented. Finally, a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qtalr) is provided which contains both a set of interactive R programming lessons (Swirl) and lab exercises designed to guide the reader through practical hands-on programming applications. The companion `qtalrkit` package and the GitHub repository are both under active development and will be updated regularly to ensure that supplementary materials remain relevant to the content of the text[^preface-2].

[^preface-2]: Errata for the textbook is found on the qtalr website.

## Getting started {#sec-getting-started}

Before jumping in to this and subsequent chapter's textbook activities, it is important to prepare your computing environment and understand how to take advantage of the resources available, both those directly and indirectly associated with the textbook.

### R and IDEs 

Programming is the backbone for modern quantitative research. Among the many programming languages available, R is a popular open-source  language and software environment for statistical computing. R is popular with statisticians and has been adopted as the *de facto* language by many other fields in natural and social sciences, including linguistics. It is freely downloadable from [The R Project for Statistical Programming](https://www.r-project.org/) website and is available for [macOS, Linux, and Windows](https://cloud.r-project.org/) operating systems.

Successfully installing R is rarely the last step in setting up your R-enabled computing environment. The majority of R users also install an **integrated development environment** (IDE). An IDE, such as [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), provide a **graphical user interface** (GUI) for working with R. In effect, IDEs provide a dashboard for working with R and are designed to make it easier to write and execute R code. IDEs also provide a number of other useful features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging. IDEs are not required to work with R but they are *highly* recommended.

Choosing to install R and an IDE on your personal computer, which is know as your **local environment**, is not the only option to work with R. You can also choose to work with R in the cloud, a **remote environment**. There are a number of cloud-based options for working with R, including [RStudio Cloud](https://www.rstudio.com/products/cloud/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/technology-choices/r-developers-guide). These options provide a pre-configured R environment that you can access from any computer with an internet connection. The advantage of working in the cloud is that you do not need to install R or an IDE on your local computer. The disadvantage is that you will need to be connected to the internet to work with R and the free tiers for these services are limited. 

If you are new to R, you may want to consider working in the cloud to get started. If you plan to continue to work with R in the future, you will most likely want to install R and an IDE on your local computer or explore using a **virtual environment**. Virtual environments, such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), provide a way to use a pre-configured computing environment or create your own that you can share with others. Virtual environments are a good option if you want to ensure that everyone in your research group is working with the same computing environment. Pre-configured virtual environments exist for R through the [Rocker project](https://rocker-project.org/) and can be used locally or in the cloud. 
 
There are trade-offs in terms of cost, convenience, and flexibility when choosing to work with R in a local, remote, or virtual environment. The choice is yours and you can always change your mind later. The important thing is to get started and begin learning R. Furthermore, any of the approaches described here will be compatible with this textbook.

### R packages 

As you progress in your R programming experience, you'll find yourself leveraging code from other R users, which is typically provided as packages. Packages are sets of functions and/or datasets that are freely accessible for download, designed to perform a specific set of interrelated tasks. They enhance the capabilities of R. Official R packages can be found in repositories like [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network), while other packages can be obtained from code-sharing platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/).

::: {.callout}
**{{< fa regular lightbulb >}} Consider this**

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) includes groupings of popular packages related to a given applied programming task called [Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). Explore the available CRAN Task Views listings. Note the variety of areas (tasks) that are covered in this listing. Now explore in more detail one of the following task views which are directly related to topics covered in this textbook noting the associated packages and their descriptions: (1) Cluster, (2) MachineLearning, (3) NaturalLanguageProcessing, or (4) ReproducibleResearch.
:::

You will download a number of packages at different stages of this textbook, but there is a set of packages that will be key to have from the get go. Once you have access to a working R/ RStudio environment, you can proceed to install the following packages.

Install the following packages from CRAN.

-   `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse]
-   `rmarkdown` [@R-rmarkdown]
-   `quarto` [@R-quarto]
-   `tinytex` [@R-tinytex]
-   `devtools` [@R-devtools]
-   `usethis` [@R-usethis]
-   `swirl` [@R-swirl]

You can do this by running the following code in an R console:

```r
 # install key packages from CRAN
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "quarto", "tinytex", "devtools", "usethis", "swirl"))
```

### Git and GitHub 

<!-- [ ]  Move the labs to qtlar and then create a starred list to link here -->

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code sharing website. Modern computing is highly collaborative and GitHub is a very popular platform for sharing and collaborating on coding projects. The [lab exercises for this textbook](https://github.com/stars/francojc/lists/labs) are shared on GitHub. To access and complete these exercises you will need to [sign up for a (free) GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) and then set up the version control software `git` on your computing environment. `git` is the conduit to interfacing GitHub and for many `git` will already be installed on your computer (or cloud computing environment).

### Getting help 

The technologies employed in this approach to text analysis will include a somewhat steep learning curve. And in all honesty, the learning never stops! Both seasoned programmers and beginners alike need assistance. Fortunately there is a very large community of programmers who have developed many official support resources and who actively contribute to official and unofficial discussion forums. Together these resources provide many avenues for overcoming challenges.

In @tbl-p-support-resources, I provide a list of steps for seeking help with R.

| Order | Resource | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Official R Documentation | Access the official documentation by running `help(package = "package_name")` in an R console. Use the `?` operator followed by the package or function name. Check out available Vignettes by running `browseVignettes("package_name")`. |
| 2 | Web Search | Look for package documentation and vignettes on the web. A popular site for this is R-Universe. |
| 3 | RStudio IDE Help Toolbar | If you're using RStudio IDE, use the "Help" toolbar menu. It provides links to help resources, guides, and manuals. |
| 4 | Online Discussion Forums | Sites like Stack Overflow and RStudio Community are great platforms where the programming community asks and answers questions related to real-world issues. |
| 5 | Post Questions with Reprex | When posting a question, especially those involving coding issues or errors, provide enough background and include a reproducible example (reprex) - a minimal piece of code that demonstrates your issue. This helps others understand and answer your question effectively. |

: Recommended order for seeking help with R. {#tbl-p-support-resources tbl-colwidths="[5, 30, 65]"}

The first place to look for help with R is the official documentation of the R package you are using. You can access this documentation by running `help(package = "package_name")` in an R console or using the `?` operator and then the package or function name. Many R packages often include "Vignettes" (long-form documentation and demonstrations). These can be accessed either by running `browseVignettes()` in an R console with the package name in quotes (e.g. `browseVignettes("tidyverse")`). 

You can also search the web for package documentation and vignettes. A popular site for this purpose is [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/). 

If you are using the RStudio IDE, the easiest and most convenient place to get help with either R or RStudio is through the RStudio "Help" toolbar menu. There you will find links to help resources, guides, and manuals. 

There are a number of very popular discussion forum websites where the programming community asks and answers questions to real-world issues. These sites often have subsections dedicated to particular programming languages or software. The most popular of these sites is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). There are also R-specific discussion forums such as [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

If you post a question on one of these communities ensure that if your question involves some coding issue or error that you provide enough background such that the community will be able to help you. This is often referred to as a **reproducible example** or "reprex". A reprex is a minimal piece of code that demonstrates the issue you are having. It is a very useful tool for both asking and answering questions. 

For information on how to create a reprex consult the following guide.

::: {.callout}
**{{< fa regular file-code >}} Guides**

- [Creating reproducible examples](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/guide-4.html)
:::

The take-home message here is that you are not alone. There are many people world-wide that are learning to program and/ or contribute to the learning of others. The more you engage with these resources and communities the more successful your learning will be. As soon as you are able, pay it forward. Posting questions and offering answers helps the community and engages and refines your skills --a win-win.

## Conventions 

To facilitate the learning process, this textbook will employ a number of conventions. These conventions are intended to help the reader navigate the text and to signal the reader's attention to important concepts and information.

### Prose 

The following typographic conventions are used throughout the text:

- *Italics*
  - Filenames, file extensions, directory paths, and URLs.

- `Fixed-width`
  - Package names, function names, variable names, and in-line code including expressions and operators.

- **Bold**
  - Key concepts when first introduced.

- [Linked text]()
  - Links to internal and external resources, footnotes, and citations including references to R packages when first introduced.

### Code blocks 

More lengthy code will be presented in code blocks as seen below.

```{r}
#| label: code-block
#| echo: true

# A function that takes a name and returns a greeting
greet <- function(name) { # function definition
  paste("Hello", name) # print greeting
} # end function definition

greet(name = "Jerid") # apply function to a name
```

There are a couple of things to note about this code block. First, this code block shows the code that is run in R as well as the ouput that is returned. The code will appear in a box and the output will appear below the box. Both code and output will appear in fixed-width font. Output which is text will be prefixed with `>`. Second, the `#` symbol is used to signal a **code comment**, a human-facing description. Everything right of a `#` is not run as code. In this textbook you will see code comments above code on a separate line and to the right of code on the same line. It is good practice to comment your code to enhance readability and to help others understand what your code is doing.

## To the instructor 

Depending on the experience level and expectations of your readers, you may want to consider adopting one of the following course designs for using this textbook.

### Basic Introduction 

- Cover chapters 1-5 in sequence to give your readers a foundational understanding of quantitative text analysis.
- Culminate the course with a research proposal assignment that requires them to identify an interesting linguistic problem, propose ways of solving it using the methods covered in class, and identify potential data sources.
- If your readers have little to no experience with R, you may want to consider using the RStudio Cloud platform to host the course. This will provide them with a pre-installed R environment and allow them to focus on learning the material rather than troubleshooting.

### Intermediate Introduction 

- Cover chapters 1, 5-10 in sequence to give your readers a deeper understanding of quantitative text analysis methods. Explore additional case studies or dataset examples throughout the course if you wish to supplement your lectures.
- Culminate the course with a research project assignment that allows your readers to apply what they've learned to linguistic content of their choice.
- You may consider using the RStudio Cloud platform to host the course, but ensure that your readers have access to R and RStudio on their own computers as well.

### Advanced Introduction 

- Cover all 12 chapters to give your readers a thorough understanding of quantitative text analysis concepts and techniques. Devote more time chapters 5-10 providing demonstrations of how to approach different problems and evaluating alternative approaches.
- Culminate the course with a collaborative research project that requires your readers to work in groups to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a given dataset.
- Ensure that your readers install R and RStudio on their own computers as they will need full control over their coding environment.


For all course designs, it is strongly recommend that you evaluate the readers' success in understanding the material by providing a combination of quizzes, lab assignments, programming exercises, and written reports. Additionally, encourage your readers to ask questions[^preface-4], collaborate with peers, and seek help from the ample resources available online when they encounter scope-limited programming problems.

For more information on how to use this textbook in your course, visit the [Instructor Guide](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/instructor-guide.html) on the compansion website.
