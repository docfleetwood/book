In this part, I introduce fundamental concepts that are essential for understanding text analysis in its research and methodological context. We start by pointing to the limitations of human cognition in processing vast amounts of information and that underscore the need for scientific methods to objectively analyze data. A brief history of quantitative data analysis highlights the commonalities between text analysis and other quantitative methods. We then discuss the role of quantitative methods in language research, and how text analysis contributes to the field.
