# Communication {#part-communication}

In this part, I cover the what, why, and how to communicate research findings both as research documents and as a reproducible research project. Both research documents and reproducible projects are fundamental components of modern scientific inquiry. On the one hand, a research document provides readers a detailed summary of the main import of the research study. On the other hand, making the research project available to interested readers ensures that the scientific community can gain insight into the process implemented in the research and thus enables researchers to vet and extend this research to build a more robust and verifiable research base.
