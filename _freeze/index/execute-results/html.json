It is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox.\n---\n\n\n<!--\n\nContent:\n\n- [ ] check for first use of package and citation, only first use.\n- [ ] Add citations for data/ datasets used in the book.\n- [ ] Add a section on how to report errors in the book.\n- [ ] Add a section on how to cite the book.\n- [ ] Add appropriate creative commons license for the web book.\n\nFormatting:\n\n- [ ] Change Examples to Snippets, where appropriate\n- [ ] Reduce the font size of callouts in the PDF version\n- [ ] Update figures to high-res, greyscale\n- [ ] Add alt text to figures (see @fig-summaries-boxplots-belc)\n\n\n- [ ] Global: object naming conventions\n- [ ] p-value, n-gram, or $p$-value, $n$-gram, etc. (use math mode)?\n- [ ] Figure and table captions: end with a period?\n- [ ] Object types:\n    - _vec for vectors? or _num, _chr?\n    - _df for data frames\n    - _tbl for tibbles\n    - _lst for lists\n    - _mat for matrices\n    - _tdm for term-document matrices\n    - _dtm for document-term matrices\n    - _rec for recipes\n    - _spc model specifications\n    - _spl for splits\n    - _wflow for workflows\n    - _rsmp for resamples\n    - _fit for fitted models\n    - _mod for vector models\n    - _dist for distance matrices\n    - _clust for clustering objects\n    - _cv for cross-validation objects\n    - _coef for coefficients\n    - _ci for confidence intervals\n  - [ ] Object content:\n    - _spk_ for spoken data\n    - _wrt_ for written data\n    - _tok_ for tokenized data\n    - _lem_ for lemmatized data\n    - _pos_ for part-of-speech tagged data\n    - _pred_ for prediction data\n    - _train_ for training data\n    - _test_ for test data\n    - other conventions: _\n  - code-block names:\n    - [ ] chapter-data-operation\n    - [ ] operations:\n      - load for loading packages\n      - read for reading data\n      - prep for preparing data\n      - show for showing data\n      - plot for plotting data\n      - model for modeling data\n      - eval for evaluating data\n      - write for writing data\n      - sum for summarizing data\n      - sel for selecting data\n      - join for joining\n      - other conventions?\n\nWaiting:\n\n- [ ] Create/ Buy domain name for the book (e.g. qta4l.com)\n- [ ] Add indexing to the key terms in the book (can Quarto do HTML indexing?)\n- [ ] [plausible](https://plausible.io/) is a privacy-conscious alternative to Google Analytics (paid service, or self-hosted)\n\n-->\n\n## About {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\n**Book**\n\nThe goal of this textbook is to provide readers with foundational knowledge and practical skills in quantitative text analysis using the R programming language.\n\nBy the end of this textbook, readers will be able to identify, interpret and evaluate data analysis procedures and results to support research questions within language science. Additionally, readers will gain experience in designing and implementing research projects that involve processing and analyzing textual data employing modern programming strategies. This textbook aims to instill a strong sense of reproducible research practices, which are critical for promoting transparency, verification, and sharing of research findings.\n\nThis textbook is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox. It assumes no prior knowledge of programming or quantitative methods and prioritizes practical application and intuitive understanding over technical details.\n\n**Author**\n\nDr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of language corpora from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work by [Jerid C.
