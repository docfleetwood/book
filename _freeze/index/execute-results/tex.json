His research focuses on the use of large-scale language archives (corpora) from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/\"><img src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/88x31.png\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\"/></a><br />This work by [Jerid C.
