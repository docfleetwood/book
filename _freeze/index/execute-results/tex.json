It is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox. It assumes no prior knowledge of programming or quantitative methods and prioritizes practical application and intuitive understanding over technical details.\n\nBy the end of this textbook, readers will be able to identify, interpret and evaluate data analysis procedures and results to support research questions within language science. Additionally, readers will gain experience in designing and implementing research projects that involve processing and analyzing textual data employing modern programming strategies. This textbook aims to instill a strong sense of reproducible research practices, which are critical for promoting transparency, verification, and sharing of research findings.\n\n**Author**\n\nDr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of language corpora from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.\n\n### License {.unnumbered}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work by [Jerid C.
