Where the creation of information from data involves human intervention and conscious decisions, as we have seen, deriving knowledge from information involves another level of intervention. The goal is to break down complex information into simpler components which are more readily interpretable. In what follows, we will cover the main steps in the process of analysis. The first is to inspect the data to ensure its quality and understand its characteristics. The second is to interrogate the data to uncover patterns and relationships and interpret the findings. To conclude this chapter, I will outline methods to and the importance of communicating the analysis results and procedure in a transparent and reproducible manner.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa terminal >}} Lessons**\n\n**What**: [Summarizing data, Visual summaries](https://github.com/qtalr/lessons)\\\n**How**: In an R console, load `swirl`, run `swirl()`, and follow prompts to select the lesson.\\\n**Why**: To showcase methods for statistical summaries of vectors and data frames and to create informative graphics that enhance data interpretation and analysis.\n:::\n\n<!-- Set up the dataset/ dictionary -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<!-- Load dataset/ origin/ dictionary -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Describe {#sec-aa-describe}\n\n<!-- Purpose -->\n\nThe goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize the data in order to understand and prepare the data for the analysis approach to be performed. This is accomplished through a combination of statistic measures and/ or tabular or graphic summaries. The choice of descriptive statistics is guided by the type of data, as well as the question(s) being asked of the data.\n\nIn descriptive statistics, there are four basic questions that are asked of each of the variables in the dataset. Each correspond to a different type of descriptive measure.\n\n1. **Central Tendency**: Where do the data points tend to be located?\n2. **Dispersion**: How spread out are the data points?\n3. **Distribution**: What is the overall shape of of the data points?\n4. **Association**: How are these data points related to other data points?\n\n<!-- Dataset used to groud the discussion -->\n\nTo ground this discussion I will introduce a new dataset. This dataset is drawn from the Barcelona English Language Corpus (BELC) [@Munoz2006], which is found in the TalkBank repository. I've selected the \"Written composition\" task from this corpus which contains 80 writing samples from 36 second language learners of English at different ages. Participants were given the task of writing for 15 minutes on the topic of \"Me: my past, present and future\". Data was collected for participants from one to three times over the course of seven years (at 10, 12, 16, and 17 years of age).\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-dd we see the data dictionary for the BELC dataset which reflects structural and transformational steps I've done so we start with a tidy dataset with `essay_id` as the unit of observation.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-dd .cell tbl-cap='Data dictionary for the BELC dataset.' tbl-colwidths='[13,17,15,55]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| variable | name             | variable_type | description                                                                   |\n+==========+==================+===============+===============================================================================+\n| essay_id | Essay ID         | categorical   | Unique identifier for each essay                                              |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| part_id  | Participant ID   | categorical   | Identifier for each participant learner                                       |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| sex      | Sex              | categorical   | Sex of the participant                                                        |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| group    | Group            | ordinal       | Time group of the essay, ordered from T1 to T4 (10, 12, 16, and 17 years old) |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| tokens   | Tokens           | numeric       | Number of word tokens in the essay                                            |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| types    | Types            | numeric       | Number of unique word types in the essay                                      |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ttr      | TTR              | numeric       | Type-Token Ratio (TTR) of the essay                                           |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| prop_l2  | Proportion of L2 | numeric       | Proportion of words in the essay identified as second (target) language (L2)  |\n+----------+------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data dictionary provides a easily accessible overview of the dataset. This includes a human-readable mapping from variable names to variable descriptions. Further, it provides information about the type of variable (e.g., categorical, ordinal, numeric). As we will see the informational type of variables is key to descriptive measures, as well as all other components of analysis.\n\nNow, let's take a look a the first few observations of the BELC dataset to get another perspective on the dataset as we view the values of the dataset.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-overview .cell tbl-cap='First 5 observations of the BELC dataset.' tbl-colwidths='[12.5,12.5,12.5,12.5,12.5,12.5,12.5,12.5]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n| essay_id | part_id | sex    | group | tokens | types | ttr   | prop_l2 |\n+==========+=========+========+=======+========+=======+=======+=========+\n| E1       | L01     | female | T2    |  79    | 46    | 0.582 | 0.987   |\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n| E2       | L02     | female | T1    |  18    | 18    | 1.000 | 0.667   |\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n| E3       | L02     | female | T3    | 101    | 53    | 0.525 | 1.000   |\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n| E4       | L05     | female | T1    |  20    | 17    | 0.850 | 0.900   |\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n| E5       | L05     | female | T3    | 158    | 80    | 0.506 | 0.987   |\n+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+-------+---------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-overview, each of the variable are attributes or measures of the `essay_id` variable. `tokens` is the number of total words, `types` is the number of unique words, `ttr` is the ratio of unique words to total words. This is known as the Type-Token Ratio and it is a standard metric for measuring lexical diversity. Finally, the proportion of L2 words (English) to the total words (tokens) is provided in `prop_l2`.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa regular file-alt >}} Case study**\n\nType-Token Ratio is a standard metric for measuring lexical diversity, but it is not without its flaws. Most importantly, TTR is highly sensitive to the word length of the text. @Duran2004 discuss this limitation, and the limitations of other lexical diversity measures and propose a new measure $D$ which shows a stronger correlation with language proficiency in their comparative studies.\n:::\n\nLet's now turn our attention to exploring descriptive measures using the BELC dataset.\n\n### Central tendency {#sec-aa-central-tendency}\n\n<!-- Location -->\n<!-- - Central tendency (mean, median, mode) -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe central tendency is measure which aims to summarize the data points in a variable as the most representative, middle or most typical value. There are three common measures of central tendency: the mode, mean and median. Each differ in how they summarize the data points.\n\nThe **mode** is the value, or values, that appears most frequently in a set of values. If there are multiple values with the highest frequency, then the variable is said to be multimodal. The most versatile of the central tendency measures as it can be applied to all levels of measurement, although the mode is not often used for numeric variables as it is not as informative as other measures.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa lightbulb >}} Consider this**\n\n::: {layout=\"[60, -3, 40]\" layout-valign=\"top\" layout-align=\"left\"}\n\n::: {#first}\n@Grieve2018 compiled a 8.9 billion-word corpus of geotagged posts from Twitter between 2013-2014 in the United States. The authors provide a [search interface](https://isogloss.shinyapps.io/isogloss/) to explore relationship between lexical usage and geographic location. Explore this corpus searching for terms related to slang (\"hella\", \"wicked\"), geographical (\"mountain\", \"river\"), meteorological (\"snow\", \"rain\"), and/ or any other term types. What types of patterns do you find? What are the benefits and/ or limitations of this type of data, data summarization, and/ or interface?\n:::\n\n::: {#second}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example distribution of the term 'Ya'll' the Word Mapper project.](figures/ud-word-mapper.png){#fig-ud-word-mapper width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\nThe more common measures for numeric variables are the mean and the median. The **mean** is a summary statistic calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. The **median** is calculated by sorting all the values in the variable and then selecting the middle value. Given that the mean and median are calculated differently, they will not always yield the same result. Differences that appear between the mean and median will be of interest to us later in this chapter.\n\n### Dispersion\n\nThe mean, median, and mode provide summary information where data points tend to be located. However, they do not provide us with any understanding as to how representative this value is. To provide this context, the spread of the values around the central tendency, or **dispersion**, is calculated.\n\nFor categorical variables, the spread is framed in terms of how balanced the values are across the levels. One way to do this is to calculate the (normalized) entropy. **Entropy** is a measure of uncertainty. The more balanced the values are across the levels, the closer entropy is 1. In practice, however, proportions are often used to assess the balance of the values across the levels. The **proportion** of each level is the frequency of the level divided by the total number of values.\n\nThe most common measure of dispersion for numeric variables is the **standard deviation**. The standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of the variance. The **variance** is the average of the squared differences from the mean. So, more succinctly, the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the values around the mean. Where the standard deviation is anchored to the mean, the **interquartile range** (IQR) is tied to the median. The median represents the sorted middle of the values, in other words the 50th percentile. The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. Again, just as the mean and the median, the standard deviation and the IQR are calculated in different ways, they are not always the same.\n\nLet's now consider the relevant central tendency and dispersion of the variables in the BELC dataset. In @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-categorical, we see the categorical measures.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-categorical .cell tbl-cap='Central tendency and dispersion of the categorical variables'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+----------+--------------------------------+--------------+\n| variable | top_counts                     | norm_entropy |\n+==========+================================+==============+\n| essay_id | E1: 1, E10: 1, E11: 1, E12: 1  | 1.00         |\n+----------+--------------------------------+--------------+\n| part_id  | L05: 3, L10: 3, L11: 3, L12: 3 | 0.98         |\n+----------+--------------------------------+--------------+\n| sex      | fem: 48, mal: 32               | 0.97         |\n+----------+--------------------------------+--------------+\n| group    | T1: 25, T3: 24, T2: 16, T4: 15 | 0.98         |\n+----------+--------------------------------+--------------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-categorical, the `top_counts` measure gives us a short list of the most frequent levels of the variable. From `top_count` we can gather whether the variable has one mode or is multimodel. Both `essay_id` and `part_id` have the same most frequent value for the levels listed. On the other hand, `sex` and `group` have a single mode. We can also appreciate the dispersion of these variables based on the `norm_entropy` of each variable. `essay_id` is completely balanced across the levels, so it has a normalized entropy of 1. the other variables are not as balanced, but still quite balanced as the normalized entropy is close to 1.\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-numeric, we see the numeric measures.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-numeric .cell tbl-cap='Central tendency and dispersion for numeric variables.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+\n| variable | mean  | sd    | median | iqr    |\n+==========+=======+=======+========+========+\n| tokens   | 67.62 | 44.20 | 56.50  | 61.250 |\n+----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+\n| types    | 41.85 | 23.03 | 38.50  | 31.500 |\n+----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+\n| ttr      |  0.68 |  0.13 |  0.66  |  0.149 |\n+----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+\n| prop_l2  |  0.96 |  0.10 |  0.99  |  0.027 |\n+----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-numeric, we have meansures for the mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR for each variable. The variable `tokens` has a larger difference between the mean and median than the other variables and the standard deviation is relatively large suggesting that the values are more spread out around the mean. In the case of `ttr` the mean and median are quite close and the standard deviation is relatively small suggesting that the values are more tightly clustered around the mean.\n\nWhen interpreting these numeric summary values, it is important to only directly compare column-wise. That is, focusing only on a single variable, not across variables. Each variable, as is, is measured on a different scale and only relative to itself can we make sense of the values.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa medal >}} Dive deeper**\n\nThe inability to compare summary statistics across variables is a key reason why **standardization** is often applied before submiting a dataset for analysis [@Johnson2008; @Baayen2008a].\n\nStandardization is a scale-based transformation that changes the scale of the values to a common scale, or *z-scores*. The result of this transformation puts data points of each variable on the same scale and allows for direct comparison. Furthermore, standardization also mitigates the influence of variables with large values relative to other variables. This is particularly important in multivariate analysis where the influence of variables with large values can be magnified.\n\nThe caveat is that standardization masks the original meaning of the data. That is, if we consider token frequency, before standardization, we can say that a value of 1000 tokens is 1000 tokens. After standardization, we can only say that a value of 1 is 1 standard deviation from the mean. This is why standardization is often applied after the descriptive phase of analysis.\n:::\n\nAnother thing to note in @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-numeric is that the mean and median are not the same. They are both measures of central tendency, but the mean is more sensitive to extreme values than the median. The difference between the mean and median is a numeric representation that gives us a first glimpse of the distribution of the data. With this in mind, let's turn to the distribution of the variables.\n\n### Distributions {#sec-aa-distributions}\n\n<!-- - Distributions  -->\n\nSummary statistics of the central tendency and dispersion of a variable provide a sense of the most representative value and how spread out the data is around this value. However, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the variable, it is key to consider the frequencies of all the data points. The **distribution** of a variable is the pattern or shape of the data that emerges when the frequencies of all data points are considered. This can reveal patterns that might not be immediately apparent from summary statistics alone.\n\nWhen assessing the distribution of categorical variables, we can use a frequency table or bar plot. A **frequency table** is a useful method to display the frequency and proportion of each level in a categorical variable in a clear and concise manner. In @tbl-aa-belc-frequency-table we see the frequency table for the variable `sex`.\n\n<!-- sex frequency table -->\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-frequency-table .cell tbl-cap='Frequency table for the variable `sex`.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+--------+-----------+------------+\n| sex    | frequency | proportion |\n+========+===========+============+\n| female | 48        | 0.6        |\n+--------+-----------+------------+\n| male   | 32        | 0.4        |\n+--------+-----------+------------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA **bar plot** is a type of plot where the x-axis is a categorical variable and the y-axis is the frequency of the values. The frequency is represented by the height of the bar. The variables can be ordered by frequency, alphabetically, or some other order. @fig-aa-belc-barplots is a bar chart for the variables `sex` and `group` ordered alphabetically.\n\n<!-- sex, group, and part_id barplots -->\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-barplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sex](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-barplots-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-barplots-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time group](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-barplots-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-barplots-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nBar plots for categorical variables `sex` and `group`.\n:::\n\n\nSo for a frequency table or barplot, we can see the frequency of each level of a categorical variable. This gives us some knowledge about the BELC dataset: there are more girls in the dataset and more essays appear in first and third time groups. If we were to see any clearly loopsided categories, this would be a sign of imbalance in the data and we would need to consider how this might impact our analysis.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa regular lightbulb >}} Consider this**\n\nThe goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize the data in a way that is meaningful and interpretable. With this in mind, compare the frequency table in [-@tbl-aa-belc-frequency-table] and bar plot in [-@fig-aa-belc-barplots-1]. Does one provide a more interpretable summary of the data? Why or why not? Are there any other ways you might communicate this distribution more effectively?\n:::\n\nFor numeric variables, a frequency table, as in @tbl-aa-belc-frequency-table, does not summarize a distibution well. Instead, the distribution of a numeric variable is best understood visually. Furthermore, we aim to assess the distribution of the variable in terms of the shape of the distribution and the presence of outliers.\n\nThe most common visualizations of the distribution of a numeric variable are histograms and density plots. **Histograms** are a type of bar plot where the x-axis is a numeric variable and the y-axis is the frequency of the values falling within a determined range of values, or bins. The frequency of values within each bin is represented by the height of the bars.\n\n**Density plots** are a smoothed version of histograms. The y-axis of a density plot is the probability of the values. When frequent values appear closely together, the plot line is higher. When the frequency of values is lower or more spread out, the plot line is lower.\n\nAn example of these plots is show in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens for the variable `tokens`.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density plot](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nDistribution plots for the variable `tokens`.\n:::\n\n\nBoth the histogram in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-1 and the density plot in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-tokens-2 show the distribution of the variable `tokens` in slightly different ways which translate into trade-offs in terms of interpretability.\n\nThe histogram shows the frequency of the values in bins. The number of bins and/ or binwidth can be changed for more or less granularity. A rough grain histogram shows the general shape of the distribution, but it is difficult to see the details of the distribution. A fine grain histogram shows the details of the distribution, but it is difficult to see the general shape of the distribution. The density plot shows the general shape of the distribution, but it hides the details of the distribution. Given this trade-off, it is often useful explore outliers with histograms and the overall shape of the distribution with density plots.\n\nIn @fig-aa-belc-histograms we see both histograms and density plots combined for the variables `tokens`, `types`, and `ttr`.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-histograms .cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of tokens](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histograms-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-histograms-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of types](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histograms-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-histograms-2 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Type-token ratio score](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histograms-3.png){#fig-aa-belc-histograms-3 width=384}\n:::\n\nHistograms for numeric variables `tokens`, `types`, and `ttr`.\n:::\n\n\nFocusing on the details captured in the histogram we are better able to detect potential outliers. Outliers can reflect valid values that are simply extreme or they can reflect something erroneous in the data. To distinguish between these two possibilities, it is important to know the context of the data. Take, for example, @fig-aa-belc-histograms-3. We see that there is a bin near the value 1.0. Given that the type-token ratio is a ratio of the number of types to the number of tokens, it is unlikely that the type-token ratio would be exactly 1.0 as this would mean that every word in an essay is unique. Another, less dramatic, example is the bin to the far right of @fig-aa-belc-histograms-1. In this case, the bin represents the number of tokens in an essay. An uptick in the number of essays with a large number of tokens is not surprising and would not typically be considered an outlier. On the other hand, consider the bin near the value 0 in the same plot. It is unlikely that a true essay would have 0, or near 0, words and therefore a closer look at the data is warranted.\n\nIt is important to recognize that outliers contribute undue influence to overall measures of central tendency and dispersion. To appreciate this, let's consider another helpful visualization called a **boxplot**. A boxplot is a visual representation which aims to represent the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of a numeric variable in one plot.\n\n<!-- [ ] PDF chokes on this layout -->\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot .cell layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-1 width=576}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-2 width=576}\n:::\n\nUnderstanding boxplots\n:::\n\n\nIn @fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-2 we see a boxplot for `ttr` variable. The box in the middle of the plot represents the interquartile range (IQR) which is the range of values between the first quartile and the third quartile. The solid line in the middle of the box represents the median. The lines extending from the box are called 'whiskers' and provide the range of values which are within 1.5 times the IQR. Values outside of this range are plotted as individual points.\n\nNow let's consider boxplots from another angle. Just above in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-1 I've plotted a histogram. In this view, we can see that a boxplot is a simplifed histogram augmented with central tendency and dispersion statistics. While histograms focus on the frequency distribution of data points, boxplots focus on the data's quartiles and potential outliers.\n\nI've added a dashed line in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-1 and @fig-aa-belc-histogram-boxplot-2 to signal the mean in this set of plots, but it is not typically included. I include the dashed line to make a point: the mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median. As I pointed out in @sec-aa-central-tendency, the mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. If there are extreme values, the mean will be pulled in the direction of the extreme values. The median, however, is the middle value and a few extreme values have less effect. So, when central tendency is reported, if there is a sizeable difference between the mean and the median, measures of dispersion will be larger and the direction of the difference can be used to infer the presence of outliers.\n\nReturning to outliers, it is important to address them to safeguard the accuracy of the analysis. There are two main ways to address outliers: 1) transform the data and 2) eliminate observations with outliers (**trimming**). Trimming is more extreme as it removes data but can be the best approach for true outliers. Transforming the data is an approach to mitigating the influence of extreme but valid values. **Transformation** involves applying a mathematical function to the data which changes the scale and/ or shape of the distribution, but does not remove data nor does it change the relative order of the values.\n\nIn @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed, we see two boxplots. @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-1 is the original `ttr` data and @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-2 reflects the data trimmed to remove outliers. In this case, we have removed essays with a type-token ratio of 1.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Type-token ratio score](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Type-token ratio score (trimmed)](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-trimmed-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nBoxplots for `ttr` before and after trimming.\n:::\n\n\nWe can now appreciate the relatively larger effect that the outliers had on the mean value of the `ttr` variable. As outliers are removed as the difference between the mean and median will become smaller.\n\n<!-- Normal distribution/ skewed distributions -->\n\nThe exploration the data points with histograms and boxplots has helped us to identify outliers. Now we turn to the question of the overall shape of the distribution. The key question is whether the observed distribution of each variable groups around a central tendency in a symmetrical manner or if the distribution is skewed in one direction or another.\n\nWhen values are symmetrically dispersed around the central tendency, the distribution is said to be normal. The **Normal Distribution** is characterized by a distribution where the mean and median are the same. The Normal Distribution has a key role in theoretical statistics and is the foundation for many statistical tests. This distribution is also known as the Gaussian Distribution or the Bell Curve for the hallmark bell shape of the distribution. In a normal distribution, extreme values are less likely than values near the center.\n\nWhen values are not symmetrically dispersed around the central tendency, the distribution is said to be skewed. A distribution in which values tend to disperse to the left of the central tendency is **left skewed** and a distribution in which values tend to disperse to the right of the central tendency is **right skewed**.\n\nStepping away from our BELC dataset, I've created simulated data that fit normal and non-normal, or skewed, distributions. I present each of these distributions as density plots with mean and median line overlays in @fig-aa-distributions.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-distributions .cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Left skewed distribution](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-distributions-1.png){#fig-aa-distributions-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Normal distribution](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-distributions-2.png){#fig-aa-distributions-2 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Right skewed distribution](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-distributions-3.png){#fig-aa-distributions-3 width=384}\n:::\n\nMean and median for normal and skewed distributions.\n:::\n\n\n<!-- [ ] Make note somehow that a simulation-based inference method approach will be used in this textbook @Morris2019 and @Rossman2014a -->\n\nAssessing the distribution of a variable is important for two reasons. First, the distribution of a variable can inform the choice of statistical test in theory-based hypothesis testing. Data that are normally, or near-normally distributed are often analyzed using parametric tests while data that exhibit a skewed distributed are often analyzed using non-parametric tests. Second, highly skewed distributions have the effect of compressing the range of values. This can lead to a loss of information and can make it difficult to detect patterns in the data.\n\nInterestingly, a key feature of the distribution of linguistic units (phonemes, words, morphemes, *etc*) is that they tend to be highly skewed. This is due to the fact that a small number of linguistic units are used frequently and a large number of linguistic units are used infrequently. This is known as Zipf's Law [@Zipf1949]. **Zipf's Law** is a statistical principle that states that the frequency of a word (other other linguistic units) is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. In other words, the most frequent units will appear twice as often as the second most frequent unit, three times as often as the third most frequent unit, and so on.\n\nThe plot in @fig-aa-zipf-distribution-1 is simulated data that fits a Zipfian distribution.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-zipf-distribution .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Zipfian distribution](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-zipf-distribution-1.png){#fig-aa-zipf-distribution-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Log-transformed Zipfian distribution](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-zipf-distribution-2.png){#fig-aa-zipf-distribution-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nZipfian distribution\n:::\n\n\nZipf's law describes a theoretical distribution, and the actual distribution of units in a corpus is affected by various sampling factors, including the size of the corpus. The larger the corpus, the closer the distribution will be to the Zipf distribution.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa medal >}} Dive deeper**\n\nAs stated above, Zipfian distributions are typical of natural language and are observed a various linguistic levels. This is because natural language is a complex system, and complex systems tend to exhibit Zipfian distributions. Other examples of complex systems that exhibit Zipfian distributions include the size of cities, the frequency of species in ecological communities, the frequency of links in the World Wide Web, *etc.*\n:::\n\nLet's return to the BELC dataset and assess the distribution of the variables `tokens`, `types` and `ttr` in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed to the three distributions in @fig-aa-distributions, we see that all three numeric variables in the BELC dataset are skewed to some degree, but not as extreme as the simulated data.\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed .cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of tokens](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of types](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-2 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Type-token ratio score](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-3.png){#fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-3 width=384}\n:::\n\nHistogram/ Density plots for numeric variables in the BELC dataset.\n:::\n\n\n@fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-1 and [-@fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-2] for `tokens` and `types` has a bit more right skewing than `ttr` seen in @fig-aa-belc-histogram-density-trimmed-3. This is consistent with the summary statistics for the central tendency in @tbl-aa-belc-descriptive-stats-numeric. The mean and median for `tokens` and `types` are not the same and the mean is larger than the median. For `ttr`, the mean and median is much closer.\n\nIn the case that a variable is highly skewed, it is often useful to attempt transform the variable to reduce the skewness. In contrast to scale-based transformations (*e.g.* centering and scaling), shape-based transformations change the scale and the shape of the distribution. The most common shape-based transformation is the logarithmic transformation. The **logarithmic transformation** (log-transformation) takes the log (typically base 10) of each value in a variable. The log-transformation is useful for reducing the skewness of a variable as it compresses large values and expands small values. If the skewness is due to these factors, the log-transformation can help, as in the case of the Zipfian distribution in @fig-aa-zipf-distribution-2.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that if scale-based transformations are to be applied to a variable, they should be applied after the log-transformation as the log of negative values is undefined.\n\n### Association\n\n<!-- Purpose: nature and strength -->\n\nWe have covered the first three of the four questions we are interested in asking in a descriptive analysis. The fourth, and last, question is whether there is an association between variables. If so, what is the directionality and what is the apparent magnitude of the dependence? Knowing the answers to these questions will help frame our approach to analysis.\n\nTo assess association, the number and information types of the variables under consideration are important. Let's start by considering two variables. If we are working with two variables, we are dealing with a **bivariate** relationship. Given there are three informational types (categorical, ordinal, and numeric), there are six logical bivariate combinations: categorical-categorical, categorical-ordinal, categorical-numeric, ordinal-ordinal, ordinal-numeric, and numeric-numeric.\n\nThe directionality of a relationship will take the form of a tabular or graphic summary depending on the informational value of the variables involved. In @tbl-aa-summary-types, we see the appropriate summary types for each of the six bivariate combinations.\n\n|                 | Categorical       | Ordinal                     | Numeric              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Categorical** | Contingency table | Contingency table/ Bar plot | Pivot table/ Boxplot |\n| **Ordinal**     | -                 | Contingency table/ Bar plot | Pivot table/ Boxplot |\n| **Numeric**     | -                 | -                           | Scatterplot          |\n\n: Appropriate summary types for different combinations of variable types. {#tbl-aa-summary-types}{tbl-colwidths=\"[14, 22, 30, 22]\" .sm .striped}\n\n<!-- Nominal + ? -->\n\nLet's first start with the combinations that include a categorical or ordinal variable. Categorical and ordinal variables reflect measures of class-type information, with add meaningful ranks to ordinal variables. To assess a relationship with these variable types, a table is always a good place to start. When combined together, a contingency table is the appropriate table. A **contingency table** is a cross-tabulation of two class-type variables, basically a two-way frequency table. This means that three of the six bivariate combinations are assessed with a contingency table: categorical-categorical, categorical-ordinal, and ordinal-ordinal.\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-contingency-tables we see contingency tables for the categorical variable `sex` and ordinal variable `group` in the BELC dataset.\n\n<!-- sex + group contingency table -->\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-contingency-tables .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" tbl-cap='Contingency tables for categorical variable `sex` and ordinal variable `group` in the BELC dataset.' tbl-subcap='[\"Counts\",\"Percentages\"]'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n| group | female | male | Total |\n+=======+========+======+=======+\n| T1    | 7      | 9    | 16    |\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n| T2    | 11     | 4    | 15    |\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n| T3    | 13     | 10   | 23    |\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n| T4    | 9      | 5    | 14    |\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n| Total | 40     | 28   | 68    |\n+-------+--------+------+-------+\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n| group | female | male   | Total   |\n+=======+========+========+=========+\n| T1    | 43.75% | 56.25% | 100.00% |\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n| T2    | 73.33% | 26.67% | 100.00% |\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n| T3    | 56.52% | 43.48% | 100.00% |\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n| T4    | 64.29% | 35.71% | 100.00% |\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n| Total | 58.82% | 41.18% | 100.00% |\n+-------+--------+--------+---------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA contingency table may include only counts, as in @tbl-aa-belc-contingency-tables-1, or may include proportions or percentages in an effort to normalize the counts and make them more comparable, as in @tbl-aa-belc-contingency-tables-2.\n\nIt is sometimes helpful to visualize a contingency table as a bar plot when there are a larger number of levels in either or both of the variables. Again, looking at the relationship between `sex` and `group`, we see that we can plot the counts or the proportions. In @fig-aa-belc-bar-plots, we see both.\n\n<!-- sex + group bar plots (counts/ proportions) -->\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-bar-plots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Counts](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-bar-plots-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-bar-plots-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proportions](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-bar-plots-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-bar-plots-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nBar plots for the relationship between `sex` and `group` in the BELC dataset.\n:::\n\n\nTo summarize and assess the relationship between a categorical or an ordinal variable and a numeric variable, we cannot use a contingency table. Instead, this type of relationship is best summarized in a table using a summary statistic in a **pivot table**. A pivot table is a table in which a class-type variable is used to group a numeric variable by some summary statistic appropriate for numeric variables, *e.g.* mean, median, standard deviation, *etc.*\n\nIn @tbl-aa-belc-pivot-table, we see a pivot table for the relationship between `group` and `tokens` in the BELC dataset. Specifically, we see the mean number of tokens by group.\n\n<!-- group + tokens pivot table (mean) -->\n\n\n::: {#tbl-aa-belc-pivot-table .cell tbl-cap='Pivot table for the relationship between `group` and `tokens` in the BELC dataset.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+-------+-------------+\n| group | mean_tokens |\n+=======+=============+\n| T1    |  35.4       |\n+-------+-------------+\n| T2    |  62.5       |\n+-------+-------------+\n| T3    |  85.0       |\n+-------+-------------+\n| T4    | 118.9       |\n+-------+-------------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the mean number of tokens increases from Group T1 to T4, which is consistent with the idea that the students in the higher groups are writing longer essays.\n\nAlthough a pivot table may be appropriate for targeted numeric summaries, a visualization is often more informative for assessing the dispersion and distribution of a numeric variable by a categorical or ordinal variable. There are two main types of visualizations for this type of relationship: a boxplot and a **violin plot**. A violin plot is a visualization that summarizes the distribution of a numeric variable by a categorical or ordinal variable, adding the overall shape of the distribution, much as a density plot does for histograms.\n\nIn @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot, we see both a boxplot and a violin plot for the relationship between `group` and `tokens` in the BELC dataset.\n\n<!-- group + tokens boxplot/ voilin plot -->\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplot](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Violin plot](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nBoxplot and violin plot for the relationship between `group` and `tokens` in the BELC dataset.\n:::\n\n\nFrom the boxplot in @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-1, we see that the general trend towards more tokens used by students in higher groups. But we can also appreciate the dispersion of the data within each group looking at the boxes and whiskers. On the surface it appears that the data for groups T1 and T3 are closer to each other than groups T2 and T4, in which there is more variability within these groups. Furthermore, we can see outliers in groups T1 and T3, but not in groups T2 and T4. From the violin plot in @fig-aa-belc-boxplot-violin-plot-2, we can see the same information, but we can also see the overall shape of the distribution of tokens within each group. In this plot, it is very clear that group T4 includes a wide range of token counts.\n\n<!-- Numeric + Numeric -->\n\nThe last bivariate combination is numeric-numeric. To summarize this type of relationship a scatterplot is used. A **scatterplot** is a visualization that plots each data point as a point in a two-dimensional space, with one numeric variable on the x-axis and the other numeric variable on the y-axis. Depending on the type of relationship you are trying to assess, you may want to add a trend line to the scatterplot. A trend line is a line that summarizes the overall trend in the relationship between the two numeric variables. To assess the extent to which the relationship is linear, a straight line is drawn which minimizes the distance between the line and the points.\n\nIn @fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot, we see a scatterplot and a scatterplot with a trend line for the relationship between `ttr` and `types` in the BELC dataset.\n\n<!-- ttr + types scatter plot: points, points + trend line -->\n\n\n::: {#fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot-1.png){#fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot-1 width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points with a linear trend line](approaching-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot-2.png){#fig-aa-belc-scatter-plot-2 width=384}\n:::\n\nScatter plot for the relationship between `ttr` and `types` in the BELC dataset.\n:::\n\n\nWe see that there is an apparent positive relationship between these two variables, which is consistent with the idea that as the number of types increases, the type-token ratio increases. In other words, as the number of unique words increases, so does the lexical diversity of the text. Since we are evaluating a linear relationship, we are assessing the extent to which there is a **correlation** between `ttr` and `types`. A correlation simply means that as the values of one variable change, the values of the other variable change in a consistent manner.\n\nBefore moving on to the next section, it is important to remember than through the process of descriptive measures, we gain a thorough understanding of our data's characteristics and quality, preparing us for the analysis. The decisions we make at this stage, from estimating central tendency to understanding the possible association between our variables, can have significant implications on our approach and interpretation in the subsequent analysis. So, this initial step of data analysis deserves our careful attention and scrutiny.\n\n## Analyze {#sec-aa-analyze}\n\nThe goal of analysis, generally, is to generate knowledge from information. The type of knowledge generated and the process by which it is generated, however, differ and can be broadly grouped into three analysis types: exploratory, predictive, and inferential.\n\n\n| Type | Aims | Approach | Methods | Evaluation |\n|------|------|----------|---------|------------|\n| Exploratory | Explore: gain insight | Inductive, data-driven, and iterative | Descriptive, pattern detection with machine learning (unsupervised) | Associative |\n| Predictive | Examine: validate associations | Semi-deductive, data-/ theory-driven, and iterative | Predictive modeling with machine learning (supervised) | Model performance, feature importance, and associative |\n| Inferential | Explain: test hypotheses | Deductive, theory-driven, and non-iterative | Hypothesis testing with statistical tests | Causal |\n\n: Overview of analysis types. {#tbl-aa-analysis-types}{tbl-colwidths=\"[10, 15, 15, 20, 20]\" .striped}\n\nIn this section, I will elaborate briefly on the distinctions between analysis types seen in @tbl-aa-analysis-types. I will structure the discussion moving from the least structured (inductive) to most structured (deductive) approach to deriving knowledge from information with the aim to provide enough information for you to identify these research approaches in the literature and to make appropriate decisions as to which approach your research should adopt.\n\n### Explore {#sec-aa-explore}\n\nIn **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we use a variety of methods to identify patterns, trends, and relations within and between variables. The goal of EDA is uncover insights in an inductive, data-driven manner. That is to say, that we do not enter into EDA with a fixed hypothesis in mind, but rather we explore intuition, probe anecdote, and follow hunches to identify patterns and relationships and to evaluate whether and why they are meaningful. We are admittedly treading new or unfamiliar terrain letting the data guide our analysis. This means that we can use and reuse the same data to explore different angles and approaches adjusting our methods and measures as we go. In this way, EDA is an iterative, meaning generating process.\n\n<!-- Identification of variables -->\n\nIn line with the investigative nature of EDA, the identification of variables of interest is a discovery process. We most likely have a intuition about the variables we would like to explore, but we are able to adjust our variables as need be to suit our research aims. When the identification and selection of variables is open, the process is known as **feature engineering**. A process that is much an art as a science, feature engineering leverages a mixture of relevant domain knowledge, intuition, and trial and error to identify features that serve to best represent the data and to best serve the research aims. Furthermore, the roles of features in EDA are fluid --no variable has a special status, as seen in @fig-eda-variables. We will see that in other types of analysis, some or all the roles of the variables are fixed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Roles of variables in EDA.](figures/aa-eda-variables.drawio.png){#fig-eda-variables width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAny given dataset could serve as a starting point to explore many different types of research questions. In order to maintain research coherence so our efforts to not careen into a free-for-all, we need to tether our feature engineering to a unit of analysis that is relevant to the research question. A **unit of analysis** is the entity that we are interested in studying. Not to be confused with the unit of observation, which is the entity that we are able to observe and measure [@Sedgwick2015]. Depending on the perspective we are interested in investigating, the choice of how to approach engineering features to gain insight will vary.\n\nBy the same token, approaches for interrogating the dataset can differ significantly, between research projects and within the same project, but for instructive purposes, let's draw a distinction between descriptive methods and unsupervised learning methods, as seen in @tbl-eda-methods.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-eda-methods .cell tbl-cap='Some common EDA methods'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n+-----------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Descriptive methods   | Unsupervised learning methods |\n+=======================+===============================+\n| Frequency analysis    | Cluster analysis              |\n+-----------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Co-occurence analysis | Principal component analysis  |\n+-----------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Keyness analysis      | Topic Modeling                |\n+-----------------------+-------------------------------+\n|                       | Vector space models           |\n+-----------------------+-------------------------------+\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first group, **descriptive methods** can be seen as an extenstion of the descriptive statistics covered earlier in this chapter including statistic, tabular, and visual techniques. The second group, **unsupervised learning**, is a subtype of machine learning in which an algorithm is used to find patterns within and between variables in the data without any guidance (supervision). In this way, the algorithm, or machine learner, is left to make connections and associations wherever they may appear in the input data.\n\nEither through descriptive, unsupervised learning methods, or a combination of both, EDA employs quantitative methods to summarize, reduce, and sort complex datasets in order to provide the researcher novel perspective to be qualitatively assessed. Exploratory methods produce results that require associative thinking and pattern detection. Speculative as they are, the results from exploratory methods can be highly informative and lead to new insight and inspire further study in directions that may not have been expected.\n\n### Predict {#sec-aa-predict}\n\n**Predictive Data Analysis (PDA)** employs a variety of techniques to examine and evaluate the association strength between a variable or set of variables, with a specific focus on predicting a target variable. The aim of PDA is to construct models that can accurately forecast future outcomes, using either data-driven or theory-driven approaches. In this process, **supervised learning** methods, where the machine learning algorithm is guided (supervised) by a target outcome variable, are used. This means we don't begin PDA with a completely open-ended exploration, but rather with an objective - accurate predictions. However, the path to achieving this objective can be flexible, allowing us freedom to adjust our models and methods. Unlike EDA, where the entire dataset can be reused for different approaches, PDA requires a portion of the data to be reserved for evaluation, enhancing the validity of our predictive models. Thus, PDA is an iterative process that combines the flexibility of exploratory analysis with the rigor of confirmatory analysis.\n\n<!-- Identification of variables -->\n\nThere are two types of variables in PDA: the outcome variable and the predictor variables, or features. The **outcome variable** is the variable that the researcher is trying to predict. It is the only variable that is necessarily fixed as part of the research question. The features are the variables that are used to predict the outcome variable. An overview of the roles of these variables in PDA is shown in @fig-pda-variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Roles of variables in PDA.](figures/aa-pda-variables.drawio.png){#fig-pda-variables width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFeature selection can be either data-driven or theory-driven. Data-driven features are those that are engineered to enhance predictive power, while theory-driven features are those that are selected based on theoretical relevance.\n\nThe approach to interrogating the dataset includes three main steps: feature engineering, model selection, and model evaluation. We've discussed feature engineering, so what is model selection and model evaluation? And how do we go about performing these steps?\n\n**Model selection** is the process of choosing a machine learning algorithm and set of features that produces the best prediction accuracy for the outcome variable. To refine our approach such that we arrive at the best combination of algorithm and features, we need to train our machine learner on a variety of combinations and evaluate the accuracy of each. We don't want to train and evaluate on the same data, as this would be cheating, and likely would not produce a model that generalizes well to new data. Instead, we split our data into two sets: a training set and a test set. The **training set** is used to train the machine learner, while the **test set** is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model[^dev-set]. The larger portion of the data, from 60% to 80%, is used for training, while the remaining portion is used for testing.\n\n[^dev-set]: Depending on the application and the amount of available data, a third *development set* is sometimes created as a pseudo test set to facilitate the testing of multiple approaches on data outside the training set before the final evaluation on the test set is performed.\n\n<!--\n- Methods\n  - Classification\n    - Logistic regression, decision trees/ random forests, naive Bayes\n  - Regression\n    - Linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks\n-->\n\nThe elephant in the room is, what type of machine learning algorithm do I use? Well, there are many different types of machine learning algorithms, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The first rough cut is to decide what type of outcome variable we are predicting: categorical or numeric. If the outcome variable is categorical, we are performing a **classification** task, and if the outcome variable is numeric, we are performing a **regression** task. As we see in @tbl-pda-algorithms, there are various algorithms that can be used for each task.\n\n| Classification         | Regression                |\n|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|\n| Logistic Regression    | Linear Regression         |\n| Random Forest Classifier         | Random Forest Regressor           |\n| Support Vector Machine | Support Vector Regression |\n| Neural Network Classifier  | Neural Network Regressor     |\n\n: Some common supervised learning algorithms used in PDA. {#tbl-pda-algorithms tbl-colwidths=\"[33, 33, 33]\" .sm .striped}\n\nThere are a number of algorithm-specific strengths and weaknesses to be considered in the process of model selection. These hinge on characteristics of the data, such as the size of the dataset, the number of features, the type of features, and the expected type of relationships between features or on computing resources, such as the amount of time available to train the model or the amount of memory available to store the model.\n\n**Model evaluation** is the process of assessing the accuracy of the model on the test set, which is a proxy for how well the model will generalize to new data. Model evaluation is performed quantitatively by calculating the accuracy of the model on the training, to develop the model, and ultimately, the test set. It is important to note that whether the accuracy metrics are good is to some degree qualitative judgment.\n\nIn the end, PDA offers a versitle path to discover data-driven insights, to probe theory-driven associations, or even simply to perform tasks that are too complex or time-consuming for humans to perform.\n\n### Infer {#sec-aa-infer}\n\nThe most commonly recognized of the three data analysis approaches, **Inferential data analysis (IDA)** is the bread-and-butter of science. IDA is a deductive, theory-driven approach in which all aspects of analysis stem from a pre-determined premise, or hypothesis, about the nature of a relationship in the world and then aims to test whether this relationship is statistically supported given the evidence. Since the goal is to infer conclusions about a certain relationship in the population based on a statistical evaluation of a (corpus) sample, the representativeness of the sample is of utmost importance. Furthermore, the use of the data is limited to the scope of the hypothesis --that is, the data cannot be used iteratively for exploratory purposes.\n\n<!-- Identify variables -->\n\nThe selection of variables and the roles they play in the analysis are determined by the hypothesis. In a nutshell, a **hypothesis** is a formal statement about the state of the world. This statement is theory-driven meaning that it is predicated on previous research. We are not exploring or examining relationships, rather we are testing a specific relationship. In practice, however, we are in fact proposing two mutally exclusive hypotheses. The first is the **Alternative Hypothesis**, or $H_1$. This is the hypothesis I just described --the statement grounded in the previous literature outlining a predicted relationship. The second is the **Null Hypothesis**, or $H_0$. This is the flip-side of the hypothesis testing coin and states that there is no difference or relationship. Together $H_1$ and $H_0$ cover all logical outcomes.\n\nNow, in standard IDA one variable is the response variable and one or more variables are explanatory variables. The **response variable**, sometimes referred to as the outcome or dependent variable, is the variable which contains the information which is hypothesized to depend on the information in the explanatory variable(s). It is the variable whose variation a research study seeks to explain. An **explanatory variable**, sometimes referred to as a independent or predictor variable, is a variable whose variation is hypothesized to explain the variation in the response variable.\n\nExplanatory variables add to the complexity of a study because they are part of our research focus, specifically our hypothesis. It is, however, common to include other variables which are not of central focus, but are commonly assumed to contribute to the explanation of the variation of the response variable. These are known as **control variables**. Control variables are included in the analysis to account for the influence of other variables on the relationship between the response and explanatory variables, but will not be included in the hypothesis nor interpreted in our results.\n\nWe can now see in @fig-aa-ida-variables the variables roles assigned to variables in a hypothesis-driven study.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Roles of variables in IDA.](figures/aa-ida-variables.drawio.png){#fig-aa-ida-variables width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAt this point let's look at the main characteristics that need to be taken into account to statistically interrogate the variables we have chosen to test our hypothesis. The type of statistical test that one chooses is based on (1) the informational value of the dependent variable and (2) the number of predictor variables included in the analysis. Together these two characteristics go a long way in determining the appropriate class of statistical test (see @Gries2013a and @Paquot2020a for a more exhaustive description).\n\nIDA relies heavily on quantitative evaluation methods to draw conclusions that can be generalized to the target population. It is key to understand that our goal in hypothesis testing is not to find evidence in support of $H_1$, but rather to assess the likelihood that we can reliably reject $H_0$.\n\nThe metric used to determine if there is sufficient evidence is based on the probability that given the nature of the relationship and the characteristics of the data, the likelihood of there being no difference or relationship is low. The threshold for likelihood has traditionally been summarized in the $p$-value statistic. In the Social Sciences, a $p$-value lower than .05 is considered *statistically significant* which when interpreted correctly means that there is more than a 95% chance that the observed relationship would not be predicted by $H_0$.\n\nNote that we are working in the realm of probability, not in absolutes, therefore an analysis that produces a significant result does not prove $H_1$ is correct or that $H_0$ is incorrect, for that matter. A margin of error is always present. For this reason, other metrics such as effect size and confidence intervals are also used to interpret the results of statistical tests.\n\n## Communicate {#sec-aa-communicate}\n\n<!-- Purpose -->\n\nConducting research should be enjoyable and personally rewarding but the effort you have invested and knowledge you have generated should be shared with others. Whether part of a blog, presentation, journal article, or for your own purposes it is important to document your analysis results and process in a way that is informative and interpretable. This enhances the value of your work, allowing others to learn from your experience and build on your findings.\n\n### Report {#sec-aa-report}\n\n<!-- Purpose -->\n\nThe most widely recognized form of communicating research is through a report. A report is a narrative of your analysis, including the research question, the data you used, the methods you applied, and the results you obtained. We are both reporting our findings and documenting our process to inform others of what we did and why we did it but also to invite readers to evaluate our findings for themselves. The scientific process is a collaborative one and evaluation by peers is a key component of the process.\n\n<!-- Components -->\n\nThe audience for your report will determine the level of detail and the type of information you will need to include in your report but there are some common elements to reference in any report. First, the research question and/ or hypothesis should be clearly stated and the motivation for the question should be explained. This will help the reader understand the context of the analysis and the importance of the results. Second, diagnostic procedures to verifiy or describe the data should be explained. This may include anomaly correction, missing data, data transformation, etc. and/ or descriptive summaries of the data including assessments of individual variables (central tendency, dispersion, distribution) and/ or relationships between variables (association strength). Third, a blueprint of the methods used will describe the variable selection process, how the variables are operationalized, what analysis methods are employed, and how the variables are used in the statistical analysis. Fourth, the results from the analysis are reported. Reporting details will depend on the type of analysis and the particular method(s) employed. Finally, the results are interpreted in light of the research question and/ or hypothesis. This will include a discussion of the limitations of the analysis and a discussion of the implications of the results for future research.\n\n### Document {#sec-aa-document}\n\n<!-- Purpose -->\n\nWhile a good report will include the most vital information to understand the procedures, results, and findings of an analysis, there is much more information generated in the course of an analysis which does not traditionally appear in prose. If a research project is conducted programmatically, however, data, code, and documentation can be made available to others as part of the communication process. Increasingly, researchers are sharing their data and code as part of the publication process. This allows others to reproduce the analysis and verify the results contributing to the collaborative nature of the scientific process.\n\n<!-- Research compendium -->\n\nTogether, data, code, and documentation form a **research compendium**. As you can imagine the research process can quickly become complex and unwieldy as the number of files and folders grows. If not organized properly, it can be difficult to find the information you need. Furthermore, if not documented, decisions made in the course of the analysis can be difficult or impossible to trace. For this reason, it is recommendable to follow a set of best practices for organizing and documenting your research compendium. We will cover this in more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\n## Activities {.unnumbered}\n\nIn the following activies, we will build on our understanding of how to summarize data using statistics, tables, and plots. We will dive deeper into the use of the `skimr` package [@R-skimr] to summarize data and the `ggplot2` package [@R-ggplot2] to create plots. We also introduce producing Quarto tables and figures with appropriate code block options. We will reinforce our understanding of the `readr` package [@R-readr] to read in data and the `dplyr` package [@R-dplyr] to manipulate data.\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa regular file-code >}} Recipe**\n\n**What**: [Descriptive assessment of datasets](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-3.html)\\\n**How**: Read Recipe 3, complete comprehension check, and prepare for Lab 3.\\\n**Why**: To explore appropriate methods for summarizing variables in datasets given the number and informational values of the variable(s).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout}\n**{{< fa flask >}} Lab**\n\n**What**: [Trace the datascape](https://github.com/qtalr/lab-03)\\\n**How**: Clone, fork, and complete the steps in Lab 3.\\\n**Why**: To identify and apply the appropriate descriptive methods for a vector's informational value and to assess both single variables and multiple variables with the appropriate statistical, tabular, and/ or graphical summaries.\n:::\n\n\n## Summary {.unnumbered}\n\nIn this chapter we have focused on description and analysis --the third component of DIKI Hierarchy. This process is visually summarized in @fig-approaching-analysis-vis-sum.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Approaching analysis: visual summary](figures/aa-diki.drawio.png){#fig-approaching-analysis-vis-sum width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first key step in any analysis is to perform a diagnostic assessment of the individual variables and relationships between variables. To select the appropriate descriptive measures we covered the various informational values that a variable can take. In addition to providing key information for reporting purposes, descriptive measures are important to explore so the researcher can get a better feel for the dataset before conducting an analysis.\n\nWe outlined three data analysis types in this chapter: exploratory, predictive, and inferential. Each of these embodies distinct approaches to deriving knowledge from data. Ultimately the choice of analysis type is highly dependent on the goals of the research. Inferential analysis is centered around the goal of testing a hypothesis, and for this reason it is the most highly structured approach to analysis. This structure is aimed at providing the mechanisms to draw conclusions from the results that can be generalized to the target population. Predictive analysis has a less-ambitious but at times more relevant goal of examining the extent to which a given relationship can be established from the data to provide a model of language that can accurately predict an outcome using new data. This methodology is highly effective for applying different algorithmic approaches and examining relationships between an outcome variable and various configurations of variables. The ability to explore the data in multiple ways, is also a key strength of employing an exploratory analysis. The least structured and most variable of the analysis types, exploratory analyses are a powerful approach to generating knowledge from data in an area where clear predictions cannot be made.\n\nI rounded out this chapter with a short description of the importance of communicating the analysis process and results. Reporting, in its traditional form, is documented in prose in an article. This reporting aims to provide the key information that a reader will need to understand what was done, how it was done, and why it was done. This information also provides the necessary information for reader's with a critical eye to understand the analysis in more detail. Yet even the most detailed reporting in a write-up still leaves many practical, but key, points of the analysis obscured. A programming approach provides the procedural steps taken that when shared provide the exact methods applied. Together with the write-up, a research compendium which provides the scripts to run the analysis and documentation on how to run the analysis forms an integral part of creating reproducible research.\n",
