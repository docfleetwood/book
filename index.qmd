**Author**

Dr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of large-scale language archives (corpora) from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.

## Build information {.unnumbered}

<!-- This may be a unique textbook compared to others you have seen. It has been created using R itself --specifically using an R package called `bookdown` [@R-bookdown]. This R package makes it possible to write, execute ('run'), and display code and results within the text. The website for this textbook is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the complete source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lin380). -->

<!-- and automatically updated after every commit by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org).  -->

```{r}
#| include: false

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, rmarkdown, here, knitr, webshot, tadr, tidytext, webshot, DT) # default packages

ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal()) # set default ggplot2 theme

filter <- dplyr::filter # avoid conflict with `stats` package

This version of the textbook was built with `r sessioninfo::platform_info()[[1]]` on `r sessioninfo::os_name()` with the following packages: 

```{r}
#| label: session-packages
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true

pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(dependencies = FALSE, pkgs = "attached")
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```


```{r}
#| label: bib-packages
#| include: false

# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'languageR', 'quanteda.corpora', 'rvest', 'rsyntax', 'rtweet', 'quanteda', 'quanteda.textstats', 'quanteda.textmodels'
), 'packages.bib')
