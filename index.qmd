  This textbook is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and practical programming skills from Data Science that are increasingly employed in a variety of language-centered fields and sub-fields applied to the task of quantitative text analysis. It is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox.

Content:

- [ ] Shoot for 5k words per chapter (12*5k = 60k words)

- [ ] Add these to 'Consider this' or 'Dive deeper' sections.
- [ ] [plausible](https://plausible.io/) is a privacy-conscious alternative to Google Analytics (paid service, or self-hosted)
- [ ] Review chapter prose for use of active and passive voice. A balance should be struck.
- [ ] Reorder to: lessons, chapter, recipe, lab, summary, questions
  - The summary would then address the entireity of materials in the lesson, chapter, recipe, and lab.
- [ ] !: Remove lesson, recipe, lab links, make reference in the Preface
- [ ] check for first use of package and citation, only first use.

Exercises:

- [x] Change the 'Swirl lesson' to 'Tutorials' and remove the language about loading and running `swirl()`. Being that the lessons are online, I may switch from Swirl to `learnr` or `tutorial.helpers` (see <https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/index.html>)
- [x] Change lab names to reflect the task in a more inviting hands-on way. For example, "Dataset manipulation: tokenization and joining datasets" could become "Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products for sentiment analysis".
- [x] Change recipe and lab numbering to mimic the chapter numbering. That is instead of Preface (Ch. 0) Recipe #1 and Lab #1 --change to Recipe #0 and Lab #0? Then chapter 1 will have Recipe and Lab #1 and so on.
- [x] Decide on keeping/ dropping the 'technical questions' and then reformatting the questions section (as in Contributing chapter) DROP technical questions

Formatting:
- [x] Change images and figures (plots) to greyscale (no color)
- [x] Change hand-drawn figures to drawio pngs
- [ ] Update images to high-res, greyscale, and add alt text (see @fig-summaries-boxplots-belc)
- [ ] Add indexing to the key terms in the book (can Quarto do HTML indexing?)
- [x] Fix package info listing --for all packages used in the book.
- [ ] Add a section on how to cite the book.
- [ ] Add citations for data/ datasets used in the book.
- [ ] Add a section on how to report errors in the book.
- [ ] Add appropriate creative commons license for the web book.


- [ ] Global: object naming conventions
- [ ] Object types:
    - _tbl or _df for tibbles and data frames?
    - _vec for vectors? or _num, _chr?
    - _mod for models? or _fit?
    - _lst for lists?
    - _mat for matrices?
    - + other conventions? _tdm,
  - [ ] Object content:
    - _spk_ for spoken data?
    - _wrt_ for written data?
    - _tok_ for tokenized data?
    - _lem_ for lemmatized data?
    - _pos_ for part-of-speech tagged data?
    - + other conventions? _trn_ for training data? _tst_ for test data?

## About {.unnumbered .unlisted}

**Book**

The goal of this textbook is to provide readers with foundational knowledge and practical skills in quantitative text analysis using the R programming language.

By the end of this textbook, readers will be able to identify, interpret and evaluate data analysis procedures and results to support research questions within language science. Additionally, readers will gain experience in designing and implementing research projects that involve processing and analyzing textual data employing modern programming strategies. This textbook aims to instill a strong sense of reproducible research practices, which are critical for promoting transparency, verification, and sharing of research findings.

This textbook is geared towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers looking to expand their methodological toolbox. It assumes no prior knowledge of programming or quantitative methods and prioritizes practical application and intuitive understanding over technical details.

**Author**

Dr. Jerid Francom is Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics at Wake Forest University. His research focuses on the use of language corpora from a variety of sources (news, social media, and other internet sources) to better understand the linguistic and cultural similarities and differences between language varieties for both scholarly and pedagogical projects. He has published on topics including the development, annotation, and evaluation of linguistic corpora and analyzed corpora through corpus, psycholinguistic, and computational methodologies. He also has experience working with and teaching statistical programming with R.
