# Analysis {#part-analysis}

In this section we turn to the analysis of datasets, the evaluation of results, and the interpretation of the findings. We will outline the three main types of statistical analyses: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Data Analysis (PDA), and Inferential Data Analysis (IDA). Each of these analysis types have distinct, non-overlapping aims and therefore should be determined from the outset of the research project and included as part of the research blueprint. The aim of this section is to establish a clearer picture of the goals, methods, and value of each of these approaches.

Questions to address:

- What is the difference between EDA, PDA, and IDA? 

The difference between EDA, PDA, and IDA is that EDA is exploratory, PDA is predictive, and IDA is inferential. EDA is exploratory in that it is used to uncover novel patterns in the data. PDA is predictive in that it is used to make robust predictions about the future. IDA is inferential in that it is used to make inferences about the population.

- What are the research goals of each of these approaches?

The research goals of EDA are to uncover novel patterns in the data. The research goals of PDA are to make robust predictions about the future. The research goals of IDA are to make inferences about the population. Furthermore, the research goals of EDA and PDA are not to generalize to the population, but rather to uncover novel patterns (EDA) or to make robust predictions (PDA). In IDA the data is used to make inferences about the population, and so the data is used more conservatively. For this reason the use of data differs between EDA and PDA on the on the one hand and IDA on the other in that in EDA and PDA the data can be used and reused more freely, as the goal is not to generalize to the population, but rather to uncover novel patterns (EDA) or to make robust predictions (PDA). In IDA the data is used to make inferences about the population, and so the data is used more conservatively.

- What are the methods used in each of these approaches?

The methods used in EDA are descriptive methods, such as frequency analysis, collocation, dispersion, etc. The methods used in PDA are predictive methods, such as regression, classification, etc. The methods used in IDA are inferential methods, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.

- What are the strengths of each of these approaches?

The strengths of each approach depend largely on the goals of the research project. For example, EDA is useful for uncovering novel patterns in the data. Say for example we want to identify what potential differences there may be in the word usage of presidential inaugural addresses between the 20th and 21st centuries. We may find that the 21st century inaugural addresses are more likely to use the word "America" than the 20th century inaugural addresses. This is a novel pattern that we may not have expected. Furtheremore, we can now dive deeper and explore if there are co-occurring words with "America" that may be able to contextualize this finding. 

PDA is useful for making robust predictions about the future. Say for example we want to know if the language that language learners of Spanish and Spanish native speakers is different. We can apply a predictive model to gauge whether or not the language learners and the native speakers are different. If the model reliably predicts that the language learners and the native speakers are different, then we can explore the model to understand what features of the language learners' language are different from the native speakers' language. This would be a case when an algorithm is used that allows for us to see what features contribute to the predictions. In other cases we may find that another model performs better but may not allow us to see what features contribute to the predictions. But if the task ultimately is pragmatic in nature, then the accuracy of the model is more important than the interpretability of the model.


 IDA is useful for making inferences about the population. In this approach we need to have crafted a hypothesis statement which is grounded in the primary literature. So let's again consider the language use of Spanish learners and native speakers. However, in this case we may have a hypothesis that the use of copular verbs such as 'ser', 'estar', 'tener', and 'haber' will be more common in learner Spanish descriptive writing tasks as these are more common in the input that learners are exposed to. We then use inferential methods to test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, then we can make inferences about the population. If the hypothesis is not supported, then we can make inferences about the population.

Consider: adding more to do with the algorithms and the face that there is much more to continue to learn than can be covered in this introduction. -->

<!-- Points for linking chapters:
- Moving the EDA section to the beginning of the chapter as many of the exploratory methods, specifically **the descriptive methods** (frequency analyis, collocation, dispersion, etc.) are used in the predictive and inferential methods. 
- It is the case that the second part of th EDA chapter will deal with **machine learning methods**; the unsupervised variety. This would be a good intro potentially to the PDA chapter as we pick up with supervised machine learning methods.
- The **usage of data** differenly between EDA and PDA on the on the one hand and IDA on the other. In EDA and PDA the data can be used and reused more freely, as the goal is not to generalize to the population, but rather to uncover novel patterns (EDA) or to make robust predictions (PDA). In IDA the data is used to make inferences about the population, and so the data is used more conservatively.

The goals of the text analysis research may be exploratory, predictive, or inferential in nature. Each of these three goals implies a distinct research aim and is associated with a different set of statistical and evaluative methods. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a data-driven approach which aims to explore intuition, probe anecdote, and identify patterns in data that might be important for further analysis. EDA combines descriptive statistics, visualizations, and statistical learning methods in an iterative and interactive way to provide the researcher the ability to identify patterns and relationships and to evaluate whether and why they are meaningful.


The objective of predictive data analysis (PDA) is to use statistical learning methods to develop a model to predict some target outcome variable. PDA is a supervised machine learning task that uses a set of features to predict a target outcome variable. The burden of evaluation lies on the researcher to determine whether the model is able to predict the target outcome variable with sufficient accuracy. 


Inferential data analysis (IDA) aims to explain relationships between variables and the population from which the sample was drawn. IDA is a ... method that tests a relationship between features. Rigorous statistical assumptions and data selection requirements aim to ensure that the findings are generalizable to the population from which the sample was drawn.
