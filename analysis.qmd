# Analysis {#part-analysis}

In this section we turn to the analysis of datasets, the evaluation of results, and the interpretation of the findings. We will outline the three main types of statistical analyses: Inferential Data Analysis (IDA), Predictive Data Analysis (PDA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Each of these analysis types have distinct, non-overlapping aims and therefore should be determined from the outset of the research project and included as part of the research blueprint. The aim of this section is to establish a clearer picture of the goals, methods, and value of each of these approaches.

<!-- Consider: adding more to do with the algorithms and the face that there is much more to continue to learn than can be covered in this introduction. -->
