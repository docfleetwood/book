# Analysis {#part-analysis}

In this section we turn to the analysis of datasets, the evaluation of results, and the interpretation of the findings. We will outline the three main types of statistical analyses: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Data Analysis (PDA), and Inferential Data Analysis (IDA). Each of these analysis types have distinct, non-overlapping aims and therefore should be determined from the outset of the research project and included as part of the research blueprint. The aim of this section is to establish a clearer picture of the goals, methods, and value of each of these approaches.

<!-- Consider: adding more to do with the algorithms and the face that there is much more to continue to learn than can be covered in this introduction. -->

<!-- Points for linking chapters:
- Moving the EDA section to the beginning of the chapter as many of the exploratory methods, specifically **the descriptive methods** (frequency analyis, collocation, dispersion, etc.) are used in the predictive and inferential methods. 
- It is the case that the second part of th EDA chapter will deal with **machine learning methods**; the unsupervised variety. This would be a good intro potentially to the PDA chapter as we pick up with supervised machine learning methods.
- The **usage of data** differenly between EDA and PDA on the on the one hand and IDA on the other. In EDA and PDA the data can be used and reused more freely, as the goal is not to generalize to the population, but rather to uncover novel patterns (EDA) or to make robust predictions (PDA). In IDA the data is used to make inferences about the population, and so the data is used more conservatively.
