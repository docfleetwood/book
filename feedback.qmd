In a few cases a chapter will be ready for review, but I'll still be working on the exercises, callouts, *etc.* In those cases, the items that are still under development will be marked with the {{< fa wrench >}} icon.

### What to look for {.unnumbered}

As you read over the draft, I'd appreciate your feedback in the following areas:

1. Clarity and Comprehensibility
I'd love to know if you think the content is clear and easy to understand. Do you think the concepts are broken down enough? Are the examples helpful? If anything seems too jargon-y or confusing, definitely let me know.

1. Consistency
It's pretty important to keep things smooth. So, keep an eye out for any inconsistent writing styles, terminology, or layout. If something seems off, I'd appreciate it if you point it out.

1. Relevance
Does the material match the current standards and knowledge? Will it the topics and questions be of interest to linguists? If something feels outdated or irrelevant, don't hesitate to mention it.

1. Engagement
‚ÄãI‚Äã'm not looking to drop a boring read on people. So, as you're going through it, think about whether it holds your interest. Maybe ‚Äãthe prose needs more life, the examples need to be more diverse, or the exercises could be more or less challenging. If you have any ideas, I'm all ears.
