# Analysis {#part-analysis}

This part turns to the analysis of datasets, the evaluation of results, and the interpretation of the findings. We will outline the three main types of analyses: exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive data analysis (PDA), and inferential data analysis (IDA). Each of these analysis types have distinct, non-overlapping aims and therefore should be determined from the outset of the research project and included as part of the research blueprint. The aim of this section is to establish a clearer picture of the goals, methods, and value of each of these approaches.
