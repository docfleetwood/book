# Foundations {#part-foundations}

Before working on the specifics of a data project, it is important to establish a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of each of the levels in the "Data, Information, Knowledge, and Insight Hierarchy (DIKI)" (see @fig-diki-hierarchy) and the roles each of these levels have in deriving insight from data. In [Chapter -@sec-understanding-data] we will explore the Data and Information levels drawing a distinction between two main types of data (populations and samples) and then cover how data is structured and transformed to generate information (datasets) that is fit for statistical analysis. In [Chapter -@sec-approaching-analysis] I will outline the importance and distinct types of statistical procedures (descriptive and analytic) that are commonly used in text analysis. [Chapter -@sec-framing-research] aims to tie these concepts together and cover the required steps for preparing a research blueprint to guide the implementation of a text analysis project.
